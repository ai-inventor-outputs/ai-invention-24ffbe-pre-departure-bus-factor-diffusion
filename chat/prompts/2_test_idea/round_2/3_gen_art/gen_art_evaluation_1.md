<ai_inventor_context>
<ai_inventor_summary>
You are one of many LLMs in AI Inventor — an automated research system that generates NOVEL and FEASIBLE hypotheses, investigates them through experiments and research, and produces a paper.

Your output feeds other LLMs downstream. This demands your ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM reasoning — every output must be deeply thought out and maximally useful. Surface-level responses waste downstream computation.
</ai_inventor_summary>

<your_role>
YOU ARE: An artifact executor (Step 3.3: GEN_ART in the invention loop)

Executing a plan to produce a concrete artifact.
GEN_PAPER_TEXT will use your artifact in the next paper draft.

Rigorous artifact with clear results → strong paper. Sloppy artifact → misdirected research.
</your_role>
</ai_inventor_context>

<task>
Evaluate experimental results using domain-appropriate methods, metrics, and analysis techniques.
When in doubt, prefer more metrics over fewer — but only ones that make sense for the domain.
</task>

<common_mistakes_to_avoid>
- Holding multiple large objects in memory at once — process one at a time: load → compute → del + gc.collect() → next
- Loading more data than needed — select only required tables/columns/rows
- Accumulating results in loops without freeing intermediates — aggregate incrementally
- Spawning too many parallel processes — stay within the hardware limits
- Running computation without timeouts or without first testing on a small sample
</common_mistakes_to_avoid>

<system_reminder>
Do not ask follow up questions and do not ask the user anything. Execute all steps independently.
You must follow the todo list provided in each prompt exactly as written.
No placeholders, stubs, or incomplete code — all code must be complete and functional.

<process_isolation>
CRITICAL: Multiple pipeline runs may execute simultaneously on this machine. `ps aux | grep method.py` matches ALL runs, not just yours.
- NEVER kill processes by name (`killall`, `pkill -f`, `ps aux | grep ... | xargs kill`). This kills OTHER runs' processes.
- NEVER monitor processes by name (`ps aux | grep method.py`). You will see other runs' processes and get confused.
- ALWAYS use PID-based process management:
  Run: `uv run method.py & PID=$!` or `timeout <seconds> uv run method.py & PID=$!`
  Check: `kill -0 $PID 2>/dev/null && echo "Running" || echo "Ended"`
  Stop: `kill $PID`
  Wait: `wait $PID; echo "Exit code: $?"`
  Monitor: `tail -f logs/run.log & TAIL_PID=$!` then `kill $TAIL_PID` when done

title: Power Audit of the Founder-Diffusion Survival Test
summary: >-
  Re-run the placebo/falsification and robustness evaluation against the completed 69-repo/16-20-event scaled experiment output
  (art_4CZ-9Ou1G5ty), fixing the prior race condition by making eval strictly wait on the experiment's full method_out.json
  write, and add a formal power/minimum-detectable-effect analysis so the paper can state exactly how underpowered the n=16-20
  result is rather than describing it qualitatively.
runpod_compute_profile: gpu
metrics_descriptions: >-
  eval_out.json reports six blocks, computed by loading full_method_out.json from the experiment dependency (verified complete
  via a file-mtime/JSON-parse sanity check before any stats run, to avoid the previously disclosed race condition -- if the
  file is truncated or missing expected keys, the eval script must fail loudly rather than silently scoring a partial file).
  (1) pipeline_validity: unconditioned survival rate for strict (TF=1, n=16) and relaxed (TF<=2, n=20) TFDD sets, each with
  a Wilson/Clopper-Pearson 95% CI, compared against Avelino et al.'s published 41% (128/315) reference rate via a one-sample
  proportion z-test/exact binomial test -- this is a sanity check that the re-implemented DOA/TF/TFDD pipeline is not systematically
  biased, not a test of the hypothesis itself. (2) primary_regression: re-extract (not re-derive from scratch -- reuse method.py's
  already-implemented BH-corrected logistic regression code path) the founder_share and n_diffused_owners coefficients, their
  standard errors, raw p-values, and BH-adjusted q-values, for both our_method and the baseline snapshot-covariate model,
  on both the strict-16 and relaxed-20 samples (relaxed-20 is new: it was not the primary analysis in the prior iteration,
  so this doubles as a same-pipeline cross-check on the strict result -- report whether direction and rough magnitude replicate).
  (3) placebo_test: recompute the within-repo placebo-window regression coefficient on placebo_founder_share/placebo_n_diffused_owners
  (15/16 valid windows) and formally compare it to the real pre-departure coefficient using a Wald-type contrast (or, if the
  model is unstable as the -164.5-coefficient/p=1.0 result from the prior iteration suggests separation, report the placebo
  fit's separation diagnostic (e.g. via Firth penalized logistic regression to get a finite estimate) rather than an uninterpretable
  near-infinite coefficient) -- the criterion for 'placebo confirms specificity' is that the placebo coefficient's CI does
  not exclude 0 while overlapping/being materially closer to 0 than the real-window coefficient. (4) stratified_robustness:
  survival rate and, where n permits (>=3 events per cell), the founder_share coefficient sign, broken out by language (Python/JS/Go/Ruby/Java/C++)
  and by the 3 popularity strata (100-1k/1k-10k/10k+ stars) -- for any stratum cell with <3 events, report the raw counts
  and explicitly mark the cell 'insufficient_n' rather than computing a statistic that would be spurious. (5) calibration:
  bootstrap (1000 resamples, stratified by survival outcome to keep both classes represented in every resample given n=16-20)
  95% CIs on the AUC and Brier score of predict_our_method_survived_prob and predict_baseline_survived_prob already present
  in method_out.json, plus a calibration-in-the-large check (mean predicted vs observed survival rate). (6) power_sensitivity_analysis
  (the new component this artifact adds beyond re-running prior logic): using the achieved n (16 and 20), the observed covariate
  variance (e.g. SD of founder_share and n_diffused_owners across the realized sample), and a two-sided alpha=0.05 with BH
  correction for 2 tests, compute via statsmodels' power module (GLM/logistic power approximated by mapping the logistic coefficient
  to an equivalent-information Wald test, or via a Monte Carlo simulation: simulate 5000 synthetic datasets at the observed
  covariate distribution and a grid of true effect sizes, fit the same logistic model, and find the smallest effect size at
  which power=0.80) the minimum detectable odds ratio (MDE) at 80% power for each of founder_share and n_diffused_owners,
  then report the ratio of the OBSERVED coefficient magnitude to that MDE (e.g. 'observed founder_share OR-equivalent is 0.34x
  the MDE at 80% power' or 'X% of target power achieved') as a single, precise, citable number replacing the prior iteration's
  qualitative '40-50% of target' claim; separately report the n required to reach 80% power at the observed effect size, and
  its ratio to the original power-analysis target (~40 events) and to the achieved n (16-20), so the corpus-scaling gap is
  quantified in both directions (effect-size-fixed-solve-for-n AND n-fixed-solve-for-detectable-effect).
metrics_justification: >-
  The hypothesis's central claim (pre-departure diffusion predicts survival) was left explicitly open after iteration 1 --
  directionally consistent but not BH-significant at n=16-20 -- so the two things this evaluation must nail down are (a) whether
  that null is a genuine null or an artifact of the previously disclosed race condition / an unfinished experiment write,
  and (b) precisely how underpowered n=16-20 is, since 'underpowered' without a number is unfalsifiable and cannot tell a
  future iteration whether 40, 100, or 300 events are actually needed. pipeline_validity anchors the whole evaluation to Avelino
  et al.'s published rate so a reviewer can trust the re-implementation before trusting anything built on top of it. placebo_test
  is the artifact's specificity check: the hypothesis requires the diffusion signal to be a pre-departure trajectory effect,
  not a property of any arbitrary window in an active project's history, and the prior iteration's placebo result (coefficient
  -164.5, p=1.0) is itself ambiguous (possibly real null, possibly quasi-separation) and needs a numerically stable re-estimate
  (Firth) before it can be interpreted either way. stratified_robustness directly operationalizes the 'popularity/size doesn't
  explain it' half of the hypothesis (mirroring Avelino et al.'s own d=0.13-0.26 snapshot-covariate null) by checking the
  diffusion signal is not concentrated in one language or star tier. calibration matters because a coefficient can be non-significant
  yet still discriminate reasonably (or vice versa: significant yet useless for ranking), and AUC/Brier with bootstrap CIs
  at this small n communicate the honest uncertainty in both directions rather than a single point estimate that overstates
  precision. power_sensitivity_analysis is the artifact's core new contribution relative to what was already run: it converts
  the vague 'this is probably underpowered' read of iteration 1 into an exact, defensible number (MDE vs observed effect,
  and required-n vs achieved-n), which is exactly what the paper needs to state whether the scaled corpus closed the gap,
  narrowed it by a knowable amount, or actually crossed into significance -- and it gives the next iteration's corpus-scaling
  target a number grounded in the ACTUAL observed effect size and variance rather than a re-guessed target.

title: GitHub Founder-Departure Commit Corpus
summary: >-
  Built from 121 real GitHub repositories sampled via the GitHub REST search API across JavaScript/Python/Java/Go and 3 popularity
  strata (100-1k, 1k-10k, 10k+ stars), each fully cloned locally (git clone --bare) and mined with `git log --numstat` for
  complete per-commit, per-file authorship history (no GitHub API rate-limit bottleneck on commit-level data). A filter funnel
  (documented in temp/funnel_report.json) reduced these to 34 'founder-only TFDD candidate' repos meeting: >=100 total commits,
  no history-loss/squash artifact (no single commit touching >90% of all files ever seen), and a single author holding >=70%
  share of commits in the first ~50-commit/6-month window. Author aliases are resolved via GitHub's `<id>+<login>@users.noreply.github.com`
  pattern and exact email/name matching; repos with >20% bot/generic-email commits are flagged via `metadata_alias_ambiguous_repo`.
  Each of the 70,260 output examples is one (commit, file) row: `input` is a JSON string of observable commit/file-change
  features (commit index, days since repo creation, file path/extension, lines added/removed, is_creation, repo stars/forks/language)
  with author identity withheld; `output` is the 'founder'/'other' authorship label; `metadata_*` fields carry repo_id, full_name,
  license, repo_created_at, commit_sha, commit_timestamp, author_alias_key/email/name, the dominant-founder first-window share,
  and the alias-ambiguity flag. Repos with more than 4000 rows are systematically strided down to that cap (every Nth row,
  chronological order preserved) to keep multi-year histories from a few huge repos (e.g. jenkinsci/jenkins, langchain-ai/langchain)
  from dominating the corpus and to respect the size budget. Final scope (34 repos, 4 languages) is a documented reduced-scope
  fallback from the 150-250/6-language target: GitHub's unauthenticated search API caps at 10 req/min and repo cloning is
  network/time bound, so language and strata breadth were narrowed to what fit the time budget while still meeting the single-founder-start,
  >=100-commit, and non-artifact filters. Known limitation: `days_since_repo_created` can be negative for repos whose GitHub
  creation date postdates their earliest preserved commit (e.g. imported from another VCS with original timestamps kept) --
  this is a genuine provenance quirk of GitHub metadata, not a pipeline bug, and downstream users should be aware some repos
  carry pre-GitHub-import history. Validated against the exp_sel_data_out.json schema; full_data_out.json is 75MB (under the
  100MB per-file and 300MB total caps).

title: Does Founder Authority Diffusion Predict OSS Survival?
summary: >-
  Re-implements Avelino et al.'s (ESEM 2019) Degree-of-Authorship (DOA) / Truck-Factor (TF) / Truck-Factor-Developer-Departure
  (TFDD) / Active-Inactive survival pipeline directly from real GitHub commit histories via the GitHub REST search API and
  `git log --numstat` history walks (no mocked or synthetic data). Sampled 270 candidate repositories across 6 languages (Python,
  JavaScript, Go, Ruby, Java, C++) stratified by popularity tier; 69 survived the age/size filters and were fully processed
  (clone -> per-file DOA snapshots -> yearly Truck-Factor sets -> TFDD detection). Detected 16 strict founder-only (TF=1)
  TFDD events and 20 relaxed (TF<=2) TFDD events. Unconditioned 18-month post-TFDD survival rate was 31.25% (strict) / 45%
  (relaxed), in the same neighborhood as Avelino et al.'s reported ~41%, cross-validating the DOA/TF/TFDD re-implementation.
  The new contribution (our_method) is a pre-departure authority-diffusion trajectory computed in the 12-to-6-month window
  before each TFDD event: founder_share (fraction of window commits made by the founder) and n_diffused_owners (count of independent
  non-founder DOA file-owners at window end). This is compared against Avelino et al.'s own approach (baseline): snapshot
  size/popularity covariates (stars, forks, developer count) measured AT the TFDD event with no temporal trajectory information.
  Both are fit as BH-corrected logistic regressions on the same 16-event strict sample, plus a within-repo placebo/falsification
  check that recomputes the same diffusion metrics on a random non-TFDD-adjacent window (15/16 events had a valid placebo
  window) to test whether the signal is specific to the pre-departure period rather than a generic property of any window.
  A matched-pairs bootstrap risk-ratio design (stars/forks/language-bucketed low-diffusion vs high-diffusion event pairs)
  was also implemented per the plan but found 0 matchable pairs at this sample size (n_pairs=0, risk_ratio=NaN) and is reported
  honestly as inconclusive at this scale rather than fabricated. In the realized logistic fit, our_method's founder_share
  coefficient is negative (-5.56, i.e. higher founder commit-share pre-departure associates with lower survival) and n_diffused_owners
  is also negative (-0.17) in this small sample, but neither survives BH correction at n=16 (BH p>0.6 for all covariates in
  both our_method and the baseline); pseudo-R^2 is 0.175 (our_method) vs 0.211 (baseline snapshot-only), so the baseline explains
  marginally more deviance in this small realized sample. The placebo regression on random non-TFDD windows shows a much larger,
  non-significant coefficient on placebo_founder_share (-164.5, p=1.0), consistent with the placebo metric being poorly identified
  in a non-TFDD-adjacent window rather than a real effect. All numbers here are the genuine output of one completed pipeline
  run (906.7s wall-clock) with no placeholders; the honest headline is that with only 16 founder-only TFDD events the study
  is underpowered to detect a significant BH-corrected effect, and this is reported transparently (raw coefficients, p-values,
  and both BH-corrected and uncorrected results are all present in the output) rather than oversold. method.py implements
  Stages 0-9 exactly as specified in the artifact plan: GitHub API sampling with popularity stratification, exclusion-criteria
  filtering (age/size/fork), `git log --numstat` commit-history extraction, the Fritz-et-al DOA formula (3.293 + 1.098*FA
  - 0.164*sqrt(AC) + 0.230*ln(1+DL)), greedy Truck-Factor-set computation, yearly TFDD scanning with a 1-year silence threshold,
  both strict (TF=1) and relaxed (TF<=2) TFDD detection reported separately, 12-to-6-month pre-departure diffusion metrics,
  18-month post-TFDD Active/Inactive survival labeling, a within-repo placebo window falsification check, matched-pairs bootstrap
  risk-ratio, and BH-corrected logistic regression for both our_method and the baseline, with all per-event rows preserved
  in method_out.json (16 example rows under the exp_gen_sol_out schema, `dataset='founder_authority_diffusion_tfdd_survival'`,
  `input`=repo/founder identity JSON, `output`=full event record JSON, plus `predict_our_method_survived_prob` and `predict_baseline_survived_prob`
  per-example predicted probabilities). Full/mini/preview variants were generated and both files (21KB) are far under the
  100MB size-limit threshold, so no splitting was required. Downstream GEN_PAPER_TEXT should present this as a genuine re-implementation
  validated against Avelino et al.'s published survival rate, with the new pre-departure diffusion signal reported as a directionally-consistent
  but not-yet-statistically-significant finding at n=16, and should NOT claim the matched-pairs risk-ratio result since it
  produced 0 matched pairs at this scale.

Avoid re-training or re-executing the method unless absolutely necessary; prefer loading predictions from each dependency's method_out.json / predict_* fields. Read domain handbook if applicable (see <available_domain_handbooks>). Decide evaluation metrics based on artifact plan. Test basic functionality with 'uv run'.
TODO 3. Fully implement evaluation as described in artifact plan in './eval.py'. Use exp_eval_sol_out.json schema in aii-json skill for output format validation. Include everything specified in the artifact plan, but you may also implement additional relevant metrics or analysis beyond what's listed. Be very attentive to meticulously and exhaustively fix any errors in your code.

ALWAYS read before writing or editing any Python script that runs an experiment, evaluation, or data-processing job. Triggers: writing or refactoring a Python script, uv venv, uv pip install, pyproject dependencies, loguru, logging setup, try/except and error handling, pathlib, script structure, Python 3.12.

---

## Environment Setup

- Python 3.12+
- **NEVER use `pip` or `.venv/bin/pip`** — they are not installed. Use `uv` for ALL package operations:
  ```bash
  uv venv .venv --python=3.12
  source .venv/bin/activate  # or: .venv/bin/python script.py
  uv pip install pandas loguru  # NOT: pip install
  ```
- Create `.toml` file with dependencies, create uv `.venv` and activate it
- NO inline dependencies (no `# /// script` headers)

## Logging

Use `loguru` for all logging. Add a file sink alongside stdout.

```python
from loguru import logger
import sys

logger.remove()  # Remove default handler
logger.add(sys.stdout, level="INFO", format="{time:HH:mm:ss}|{level:<7}|{message}")
logger.add("logs/run.log", rotation="30 MB", level="DEBUG")
```

Rules:
- Log every major step (data loading, processing start/end, results)
- If applicable, log every LLM API call input and output
- Truncate long outputs in logs (add truncation logic for potentially large strings)
- Use `logger.error()` in except blocks (traceback auto-captured)

## Error Handling

- Wrap major operations in try/except blocks
- Use `@logger.catch(reraise=True)` decorator on main functions — without `reraise=True`, the script exits 0 even on uncaught exceptions, hiding failures from downstream consumers
- Use explicit exception types, not bare `except:`
- Never silently swallow exceptions — always log them

```python
@logger.catch(reraise=True)
def main():
    try:
        data = load_data(path)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        logger.error("Data file not found")
        raise
    except json.JSONDecodeError:
        logger.error("Invalid JSON in data file")
        raise
```

## Code Structure

- Use `pathlib.Path` for file operations: `Path("data/input.json").read_text()` not `open(...).read()`
- Use type hints for function signatures
- Use keyword arguments for functions with more than 4 parameters
- No hardcoded paths — derive from script location or accept as arguments

## Script Pattern

Standard pattern for experiment/evaluation scripts:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""Brief description of what this script does."""

from loguru import logger
from pathlib import Path
import json
import sys

logger.remove()
logger.add(sys.stdout, level="INFO", format="{time:HH:mm:ss}|{level:<7}|{message}")
logger.add("logs/run.log", rotation="30 MB", level="DEBUG")

@logger.catch(reraise=True)
def main():
    # Load data
    data_path = Path("full_data_out.json")
    logger.info(f"Loading data from {data_path}")
    data = json.loads(data_path.read_text())
    logger.info(f"Loaded {len(data['examples'])} examples")

    # Process
    results = []
    for i, example in enumerate(data["examples"]):
        try:
            result = process(example)
            results.append(result)
        except Exception:
            logger.error(f"Failed on example {i}")
            continue

    # Save output
    output = {"examples": results}
    Path("method_out.json").write_text(json.dumps(output, indent=2))
    logger.info(f"Saved {len(results)} results")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

## Contents

- Validating JSON (schema validation against experiment schemas)
- Formatting JSON (generate full/mini/preview versions)

**IMPORTANT - Parallel execution:** GNU `parallel` subshells do NOT inherit `source activate`. Use `export` for variables and **single-quoted** command templates so parallel's subshells can resolve them:
```
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json"
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python"
```

---

## Validating JSON

Validate JSON files against predefined schemas for experiment-based hypothesis selection, data collection, solution generation, and evaluation.

### Quick Start

1. Read the schema spec you need to adhere to (e.g., `schemas/exp_eval_sol_out.json`)
2. Create your output file following that schema structure
3. Validate:

```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_json_validate_schema.py --format exp_eval_sol_out --file /path/to/eval_out.json
```

### Script: aii_json_validate_schema.py

**Example input:**
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_json_validate_schema.py --format exp_eval_sol_out --file /tmp/eval_out.json
```

**Parallel execution (multiple validations):**

IMPORTANT: When validating multiple files, use GNU parallel instead of separate Bash tool calls:
```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json" && \
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python" && \
export S="$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_json_validate_schema.py" && \
parallel -j 50 -k --group --will-cite '$PY $S --format {1} --file {2}' ::: 'exp_sel_data_out' 'exp_gen_sol_out' 'exp_eval_sol_out' :::+ '/tmp/full_data_out.json' '/tmp/method_out.json' '/tmp/eval_out.json'
```

**Example output (success):**
```
Validating: aii_json_validate_schema.py
Format: exp_eval_sol_out

✓ Validation PASSED
```

**Example output (failure):**
```
Validating: aii_json_validate_schema.py
Format: exp_sel_data_out

✗ Validation FAILED

Errors:
  Path: datasets → 0 → examples → 0
  Error: 'output' is a required property
  Validator: required
```

**Parameters:**

`--format` (required)
- Format type to validate against
- Determines which schema to use

`--file` (required)
- Path to JSON file to validate
- Must be valid JSON
- **Always pass an absolute path.** Relative paths resolve from the
  ability server's CWD (typically ``/ai-inventor/aii_server``), not from
  your agent workspace, so ``data_out/x.json`` will silently look in the
  wrong directory and fail with "Could not load JSON file". The validate
  endpoint also accepts a ``workspace_dir`` arg if you need to keep a
  relative path — pass your workspace path there.

**Tips:**
- Fix errors in your JSON and rerun validation until it passes

### Schema Files

Schemas are stored in `.claude/skills/aii-json/schemas/`:

**Hypothesis Selection & Evaluation:**
- `sel_hypo_out.json` - Hypothesis Selection output (all hypotheses with selected flags)
- `feasibility_eval_all.json` - All hypotheses with feasibility scores
- `feasibility_eval_top.json` - Top 5 most feasible hypotheses
- `novelty_research_one.json` - Single hypothesis novelty research arguments with citations
- `novelty_eval_all.json` - All hypotheses with novelty scores
- `novelty_eval_top.json` - Single best selected hypothesis

**Experiment Pipeline:**
- `exp_sel_data_out.json` - Experiment Data Selection format
- `exp_gen_sol_out.json` - Experiment Solution Generation format
- `exp_eval_sol_out.json` - Experiment Solution Evaluation format

---

## Formatting JSON

Generate three size-optimized versions of a JSON file for efficient development and preview:
- **full**: Identical to original (all data)
- **mini**: First 3 items only (for quick testing)
- **preview**: Mini + all strings truncated to 200 chars (for quick inspection)

### Quick Start

```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_json_format_mini_preview.py --input method_out.json
```

### Script: aii_json_format_mini_preview.py

**Example input:**
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_json_format_mini_preview.py --input method_out.json
```

**Parallel execution (multiple files):**

IMPORTANT: When formatting multiple files, use GNU parallel instead of separate Bash tool calls:
```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json" && \
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python" && \
export S="$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_json_format_mini_preview.py" && \
parallel -j 50 -k --group --will-cite '$PY $S --input {}' ::: 'full_data_out.json' 'method_out.json' 'eval_out.json'
```

**Example output:**
```
Generated 3 versions:
  Full (50 items): /path/to/full_method_out.json
  Mini (3 items): /path/to/mini_method_out.json
  Preview (3 items, truncated): /path/to/preview_method_out.json
```

**Parameters:**

`--input` (required)
- Path to input JSON file
- Must have a top-level array
- Example: `method_out.json`, `full_data_out.json`

`--output-dir` (optional)
- Output directory for generated files
- Default: same directory as input file
- Files are prefixed with `full_`, `mini_`, `preview_`

**Output Files:**

All three files use the same base name with different prefixes:
- `full_{basename}.json` - Complete dataset (identical to original)
- `mini_{basename}.json` - First 3 array items only
- `preview_{basename}.json` - First 3 items with strings truncated to 200 chars

**Tips:**
- Input JSON must have a top-level array structure
- String truncation is recursive (applies to nested objects and arrays)
- Use preview files for quick inspection without reading large datasets
- Use mini files for developing/testing code before running on full dataset

**If the script fails** with a connection error (ability server not running): create a local `.venv`, install server deps from `server_requirements.txt` into it, then import the `@aii_ability` function from the script and call it directly — bypassing the server:
```bash
uv venv .venv --python=3.12 && uv pip install --python=.venv/bin/python -r "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/server_requirements.txt"
```

title: Power Audit of the Founder-Diffusion Survival Test
summary: >-
  Re-run the placebo/falsification and robustness evaluation against the completed 69-repo/16-20-event scaled experiment output
  (art_4CZ-9Ou1G5ty), fixing the prior race condition by making eval strictly wait on the experiment's full method_out.json
  write, and add a formal power/minimum-detectable-effect analysis so the paper can state exactly how underpowered the n=16-20
  result is rather than describing it qualitatively.
runpod_compute_profile: gpu
metrics_descriptions: >-
  eval_out.json reports six blocks, computed by loading full_method_out.json from the experiment dependency (verified complete
  via a file-mtime/JSON-parse sanity check before any stats run, to avoid the previously disclosed race condition -- if the
  file is truncated or missing expected keys, the eval script must fail loudly rather than silently scoring a partial file).
  (1) pipeline_validity: unconditioned survival rate for strict (TF=1, n=16) and relaxed (TF<=2, n=20) TFDD sets, each with
  a Wilson/Clopper-Pearson 95% CI, compared against Avelino et al.'s published 41% (128/315) reference rate via a one-sample
  proportion z-test/exact binomial test -- this is a sanity check that the re-implemented DOA/TF/TFDD pipeline is not systematically
  biased, not a test of the hypothesis itself. (2) primary_regression: re-extract (not re-derive from scratch -- reuse method.py's
  already-implemented BH-corrected logistic regression code path) the founder_share and n_diffused_owners coefficients, their
  standard errors, raw p-values, and BH-adjusted q-values, for both our_method and the baseline snapshot-covariate model,
  on both the strict-16 and relaxed-20 samples (relaxed-20 is new: it was not the primary analysis in the prior iteration,
  so this doubles as a same-pipeline cross-check on the strict result -- report whether direction and rough magnitude replicate).
  (3) placebo_test: recompute the within-repo placebo-window regression coefficient on placebo_founder_share/placebo_n_diffused_owners
  (15/16 valid windows) and formally compare it to the real pre-departure coefficient using a Wald-type contrast (or, if the
  model is unstable as the -164.5-coefficient/p=1.0 result from the prior iteration suggests separation, report the placebo
  fit's separation diagnostic (e.g. via Firth penalized logistic regression to get a finite estimate) rather than an uninterpretable
  near-infinite coefficient) -- the criterion for 'placebo confirms specificity' is that the placebo coefficient's CI does
  not exclude 0 while overlapping/being materially closer to 0 than the real-window coefficient. (4) stratified_robustness:
  survival rate and, where n permits (>=3 events per cell), the founder_share coefficient sign, broken out by language (Python/JS/Go/Ruby/Java/C++)
  and by the 3 popularity strata (100-1k/1k-10k/10k+ stars) -- for any stratum cell with <3 events, report the raw counts
  and explicitly mark the cell 'insufficient_n' rather than computing a statistic that would be spurious. (5) calibration:
  bootstrap (1000 resamples, stratified by survival outcome to keep both classes represented in every resample given n=16-20)
  95% CIs on the AUC and Brier score of predict_our_method_survived_prob and predict_baseline_survived_prob already present
  in method_out.json, plus a calibration-in-the-large check (mean predicted vs observed survival rate). (6) power_sensitivity_analysis
  (the new component this artifact adds beyond re-running prior logic): using the achieved n (16 and 20), the observed covariate
  variance (e.g. SD of founder_share and n_diffused_owners across the realized sample), and a two-sided alpha=0.05 with BH
  correction for 2 tests, compute via statsmodels' power module (GLM/logistic power approximated by mapping the logistic coefficient
  to an equivalent-information Wald test, or via a Monte Carlo simulation: simulate 5000 synthetic datasets at the observed
  covariate distribution and a grid of true effect sizes, fit the same logistic model, and find the smallest effect size at
  which power=0.80) the minimum detectable odds ratio (MDE) at 80% power for each of founder_share and n_diffused_owners,
  then report the ratio of the OBSERVED coefficient magnitude to that MDE (e.g. 'observed founder_share OR-equivalent is 0.34x
  the MDE at 80% power' or 'X% of target power achieved') as a single, precise, citable number replacing the prior iteration's
  qualitative '40-50% of target' claim; separately report the n required to reach 80% power at the observed effect size, and
  its ratio to the original power-analysis target (~40 events) and to the achieved n (16-20), so the corpus-scaling gap is
  quantified in both directions (effect-size-fixed-solve-for-n AND n-fixed-solve-for-detectable-effect).
metrics_justification: >-
  The hypothesis's central claim (pre-departure diffusion predicts survival) was left explicitly open after iteration 1 --
  directionally consistent but not BH-significant at n=16-20 -- so the two things this evaluation must nail down are (a) whether
  that null is a genuine null or an artifact of the previously disclosed race condition / an unfinished experiment write,
  and (b) precisely how underpowered n=16-20 is, since 'underpowered' without a number is unfalsifiable and cannot tell a
  future iteration whether 40, 100, or 300 events are actually needed. pipeline_validity anchors the whole evaluation to Avelino
  et al.'s published rate so a reviewer can trust the re-implementation before trusting anything built on top of it. placebo_test
  is the artifact's specificity check: the hypothesis requires the diffusion signal to be a pre-departure trajectory effect,
  not a property of any arbitrary window in an active project's history, and the prior iteration's placebo result (coefficient
  -164.5, p=1.0) is itself ambiguous (possibly real null, possibly quasi-separation) and needs a numerically stable re-estimate
  (Firth) before it can be interpreted either way. stratified_robustness directly operationalizes the 'popularity/size doesn't
  explain it' half of the hypothesis (mirroring Avelino et al.'s own d=0.13-0.26 snapshot-covariate null) by checking the
  diffusion signal is not concentrated in one language or star tier. calibration matters because a coefficient can be non-significant
  yet still discriminate reasonably (or vice versa: significant yet useless for ranking), and AUC/Brier with bootstrap CIs
  at this small n communicate the honest uncertainty in both directions rather than a single point estimate that overstates
  precision. power_sensitivity_analysis is the artifact's core new contribution relative to what was already run: it converts
  the vague 'this is probably underpowered' read of iteration 1 into an exact, defensible number (MDE vs observed effect,
  and required-n vs achieved-n), which is exactly what the paper needs to state whether the scaled corpus closed the gap,
  narrowed it by a knowable amount, or actually crossed into significance -- and it gives the next iteration's corpus-scaling
  target a number grounded in the ACTUAL observed effect size and variance rather than a re-guessed target.

title: GitHub Founder-Departure Commit Corpus
summary: >-
  Built from 121 real GitHub repositories sampled via the GitHub REST search API across JavaScript/Python/Java/Go and 3 popularity
  strata (100-1k, 1k-10k, 10k+ stars), each fully cloned locally (git clone --bare) and mined with `git log --numstat` for
  complete per-commit, per-file authorship history (no GitHub API rate-limit bottleneck on commit-level data). A filter funnel
  (documented in temp/funnel_report.json) reduced these to 34 'founder-only TFDD candidate' repos meeting: >=100 total commits,
  no history-loss/squash artifact (no single commit touching >90% of all files ever seen), and a single author holding >=70%
  share of commits in the first ~50-commit/6-month window. Author aliases are resolved via GitHub's `<id>+<login>@users.noreply.github.com`
  pattern and exact email/name matching; repos with >20% bot/generic-email commits are flagged via `metadata_alias_ambiguous_repo`.
  Each of the 70,260 output examples is one (commit, file) row: `input` is a JSON string of observable commit/file-change
  features (commit index, days since repo creation, file path/extension, lines added/removed, is_creation, repo stars/forks/language)
  with author identity withheld; `output` is the 'founder'/'other' authorship label; `metadata_*` fields carry repo_id, full_name,
  license, repo_created_at, commit_sha, commit_timestamp, author_alias_key/email/name, the dominant-founder first-window share,
  and the alias-ambiguity flag. Repos with more than 4000 rows are systematically strided down to that cap (every Nth row,
  chronological order preserved) to keep multi-year histories from a few huge repos (e.g. jenkinsci/jenkins, langchain-ai/langchain)
  from dominating the corpus and to respect the size budget. Final scope (34 repos, 4 languages) is a documented reduced-scope
  fallback from the 150-250/6-language target: GitHub's unauthenticated search API caps at 10 req/min and repo cloning is
  network/time bound, so language and strata breadth were narrowed to what fit the time budget while still meeting the single-founder-start,
  >=100-commit, and non-artifact filters. Known limitation: `days_since_repo_created` can be negative for repos whose GitHub
  creation date postdates their earliest preserved commit (e.g. imported from another VCS with original timestamps kept) --
  this is a genuine provenance quirk of GitHub metadata, not a pipeline bug, and downstream users should be aware some repos
  carry pre-GitHub-import history. Validated against the exp_sel_data_out.json schema; full_data_out.json is 75MB (under the
  100MB per-file and 300MB total caps).

title: Does Founder Authority Diffusion Predict OSS Survival?
summary: >-
  Re-implements Avelino et al.'s (ESEM 2019) Degree-of-Authorship (DOA) / Truck-Factor (TF) / Truck-Factor-Developer-Departure
  (TFDD) / Active-Inactive survival pipeline directly from real GitHub commit histories via the GitHub REST search API and
  `git log --numstat` history walks (no mocked or synthetic data). Sampled 270 candidate repositories across 6 languages (Python,
  JavaScript, Go, Ruby, Java, C++) stratified by popularity tier; 69 survived the age/size filters and were fully processed
  (clone -> per-file DOA snapshots -> yearly Truck-Factor sets -> TFDD detection). Detected 16 strict founder-only (TF=1)
  TFDD events and 20 relaxed (TF<=2) TFDD events. Unconditioned 18-month post-TFDD survival rate was 31.25% (strict) / 45%
  (relaxed), in the same neighborhood as Avelino et al.'s reported ~41%, cross-validating the DOA/TF/TFDD re-implementation.
  The new contribution (our_method) is a pre-departure authority-diffusion trajectory computed in the 12-to-6-month window
  before each TFDD event: founder_share (fraction of window commits made by the founder) and n_diffused_owners (count of independent
  non-founder DOA file-owners at window end). This is compared against Avelino et al.'s own approach (baseline): snapshot
  size/popularity covariates (stars, forks, developer count) measured AT the TFDD event with no temporal trajectory information.
  Both are fit as BH-corrected logistic regressions on the same 16-event strict sample, plus a within-repo placebo/falsification
  check that recomputes the same diffusion metrics on a random non-TFDD-adjacent window (15/16 events had a valid placebo
  window) to test whether the signal is specific to the pre-departure period rather than a generic property of any window.
  A matched-pairs bootstrap risk-ratio design (stars/forks/language-bucketed low-diffusion vs high-diffusion event pairs)
  was also implemented per the plan but found 0 matchable pairs at this sample size (n_pairs=0, risk_ratio=NaN) and is reported
  honestly as inconclusive at this scale rather than fabricated. In the realized logistic fit, our_method's founder_share
  coefficient is negative (-5.56, i.e. higher founder commit-share pre-departure associates with lower survival) and n_diffused_owners
  is also negative (-0.17) in this small sample, but neither survives BH correction at n=16 (BH p>0.6 for all covariates in
  both our_method and the baseline); pseudo-R^2 is 0.175 (our_method) vs 0.211 (baseline snapshot-only), so the baseline explains
  marginally more deviance in this small realized sample. The placebo regression on random non-TFDD windows shows a much larger,
  non-significant coefficient on placebo_founder_share (-164.5, p=1.0), consistent with the placebo metric being poorly identified
  in a non-TFDD-adjacent window rather than a real effect. All numbers here are the genuine output of one completed pipeline
  run (906.7s wall-clock) with no placeholders; the honest headline is that with only 16 founder-only TFDD events the study
  is underpowered to detect a significant BH-corrected effect, and this is reported transparently (raw coefficients, p-values,
  and both BH-corrected and uncorrected results are all present in the output) rather than oversold. method.py implements
  Stages 0-9 exactly as specified in the artifact plan: GitHub API sampling with popularity stratification, exclusion-criteria
  filtering (age/size/fork), `git log --numstat` commit-history extraction, the Fritz-et-al DOA formula (3.293 + 1.098*FA
  - 0.164*sqrt(AC) + 0.230*ln(1+DL)), greedy Truck-Factor-set computation, yearly TFDD scanning with a 1-year silence threshold,
  both strict (TF=1) and relaxed (TF<=2) TFDD detection reported separately, 12-to-6-month pre-departure diffusion metrics,
  18-month post-TFDD Active/Inactive survival labeling, a within-repo placebo window falsification check, matched-pairs bootstrap
  risk-ratio, and BH-corrected logistic regression for both our_method and the baseline, with all per-event rows preserved
  in method_out.json (16 example rows under the exp_gen_sol_out schema, `dataset='founder_authority_diffusion_tfdd_survival'`,
  `input`=repo/founder identity JSON, `output`=full event record JSON, plus `predict_our_method_survived_prob` and `predict_baseline_survived_prob`
  per-example predicted probabilities). Full/mini/preview variants were generated and both files (21KB) are far under the
  100MB size-limit threshold, so no splitting was required. Downstream GEN_PAPER_TEXT should present this as a genuine re-implementation
  validated against Avelino et al.'s published survival rate, with the new pre-departure diffusion signal reported as a directionally-consistent
  but not-yet-statistically-significant finding at n=16, and should NOT claim the matched-pairs risk-ratio result since it
  produced 0 matched pairs at this scale.

- LLM API calls must go through OpenRouter only (no direct OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- **SPEND BUDGET**: at most $10 USD of OpenRouter API calls for this artifact. Nothing outside your own code enforces this — the key you are given has no per-artifact cap — so it holds only if you track cumulative cost after every call and stop when you approach it. Budget the work up front: estimate the per-call cost and the number of calls BEFORE starting a sweep, not after it overruns. Exceeding it spends real money that the run cannot recover.

<repo_upload_exclusions>
Your finished workspace is published to a public GitHub repo. If it will hold files that should NOT be published — content-addressed caches (e.g. a `cache/` directory of thousands of hash-named files), large transient intermediates, model checkpoints, or scratch downloads — list regex patterns for them in the `upload_ignore_regexes` output field. Each pattern is matched against a path RELATIVE to your workspace root in POSIX form (e.g. `(^|/)cache/`, `(^|/)checkpoints/`). They apply on top of the built-in exclusions; leave the field empty if every workspace file should be published. Do NOT use this to hide real deliverables (code, results, datasets the paper relies on) — only genuine cache/scratch bulk.

IMPORTANT: Your final response should be at most 300 characters long.

FIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list using your task/todo-tracking tool:

CRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES. These todos are intentionally detailed so that another LLM could read each one without any external context and understand exactly what it has to do.

<todos>
TODO 1. Use aii-json skill's format script with `--input eval_out.json` to generate full, mini, and preview versions. If not in your workspace (see <workspace> above), copy them there. Run 'ls -lh' to verify these three files exist (DO NOT read them).
TODO 2. Apply aii-file-size-limit skill's file size check procedure (100MB limit) to eval_out.json and full_eval_out.json.
TODO 3. Ensure a `pyproject.toml` exists in your workspace with ALL dependencies pinned to the exact versions installed in your .venv (run `.venv/bin/pip freeze` to get them). This is required for reproducibility. The [project] section must include name, version, requires-python, and a dependencies list with pinned versions (e.g. `numpy==2.0.2`, not `numpy>=2.0`).

title: Power Audit of the Founder-Diffusion Survival Test
summary: >-
  Re-run the placebo/falsification and robustness evaluation against the completed 69-repo/16-20-event scaled experiment output
  (art_4CZ-9Ou1G5ty), fixing the prior race condition by making eval strictly wait on the experiment's full method_out.json
  write, and add a formal power/minimum-detectable-effect analysis so the paper can state exactly how underpowered the n=16-20
  result is rather than describing it qualitatively.
runpod_compute_profile: gpu
metrics_descriptions: >-
  eval_out.json reports six blocks, computed by loading full_method_out.json from the experiment dependency (verified complete
  via a file-mtime/JSON-parse sanity check before any stats run, to avoid the previously disclosed race condition -- if the
  file is truncated or missing expected keys, the eval script must fail loudly rather than silently scoring a partial file).
  (1) pipeline_validity: unconditioned survival rate for strict (TF=1, n=16) and relaxed (TF<=2, n=20) TFDD sets, each with
  a Wilson/Clopper-Pearson 95% CI, compared against Avelino et al.'s published 41% (128/315) reference rate via a one-sample
  proportion z-test/exact binomial test -- this is a sanity check that the re-implemented DOA/TF/TFDD pipeline is not systematically
  biased, not a test of the hypothesis itself. (2) primary_regression: re-extract (not re-derive from scratch -- reuse method.py's
  already-implemented BH-corrected logistic regression code path) the founder_share and n_diffused_owners coefficients, their
  standard errors, raw p-values, and BH-adjusted q-values, for both our_method and the baseline snapshot-covariate model,
  on both the strict-16 and relaxed-20 samples (relaxed-20 is new: it was not the primary analysis in the prior iteration,
  so this doubles as a same-pipeline cross-check on the strict result -- report whether direction and rough magnitude replicate).
  (3) placebo_test: recompute the within-repo placebo-window regression coefficient on placebo_founder_share/placebo_n_diffused_owners
  (15/16 valid windows) and formally compare it to the real pre-departure coefficient using a Wald-type contrast (or, if the
  model is unstable as the -164.5-coefficient/p=1.0 result from the prior iteration suggests separation, report the placebo
  fit's separation diagnostic (e.g. via Firth penalized logistic regression to get a finite estimate) rather than an uninterpretable
  near-infinite coefficient) -- the criterion for 'placebo confirms specificity' is that the placebo coefficient's CI does
  not exclude 0 while overlapping/being materially closer to 0 than the real-window coefficient. (4) stratified_robustness:
  survival rate and, where n permits (>=3 events per cell), the founder_share coefficient sign, broken out by language (Python/JS/Go/Ruby/Java/C++)
  and by the 3 popularity strata (100-1k/1k-10k/10k+ stars) -- for any stratum cell with <3 events, report the raw counts
  and explicitly mark the cell 'insufficient_n' rather than computing a statistic that would be spurious. (5) calibration:
  bootstrap (1000 resamples, stratified by survival outcome to keep both classes represented in every resample given n=16-20)
  95% CIs on the AUC and Brier score of predict_our_method_survived_prob and predict_baseline_survived_prob already present
  in method_out.json, plus a calibration-in-the-large check (mean predicted vs observed survival rate). (6) power_sensitivity_analysis
  (the new component this artifact adds beyond re-running prior logic): using the achieved n (16 and 20), the observed covariate
  variance (e.g. SD of founder_share and n_diffused_owners across the realized sample), and a two-sided alpha=0.05 with BH
  correction for 2 tests, compute via statsmodels' power module (GLM/logistic power approximated by mapping the logistic coefficient
  to an equivalent-information Wald test, or via a Monte Carlo simulation: simulate 5000 synthetic datasets at the observed
  covariate distribution and a grid of true effect sizes, fit the same logistic model, and find the smallest effect size at
  which power=0.80) the minimum detectable odds ratio (MDE) at 80% power for each of founder_share and n_diffused_owners,
  then report the ratio of the OBSERVED coefficient magnitude to that MDE (e.g. 'observed founder_share OR-equivalent is 0.34x
  the MDE at 80% power' or 'X% of target power achieved') as a single, precise, citable number replacing the prior iteration's
  qualitative '40-50% of target' claim; separately report the n required to reach 80% power at the observed effect size, and
  its ratio to the original power-analysis target (~40 events) and to the achieved n (16-20), so the corpus-scaling gap is
  quantified in both directions (effect-size-fixed-solve-for-n AND n-fixed-solve-for-detectable-effect).
metrics_justification: >-
  The hypothesis's central claim (pre-departure diffusion predicts survival) was left explicitly open after iteration 1 --
  directionally consistent but not BH-significant at n=16-20 -- so the two things this evaluation must nail down are (a) whether
  that null is a genuine null or an artifact of the previously disclosed race condition / an unfinished experiment write,
  and (b) precisely how underpowered n=16-20 is, since 'underpowered' without a number is unfalsifiable and cannot tell a
  future iteration whether 40, 100, or 300 events are actually needed. pipeline_validity anchors the whole evaluation to Avelino
  et al.'s published rate so a reviewer can trust the re-implementation before trusting anything built on top of it. placebo_test
  is the artifact's specificity check: the hypothesis requires the diffusion signal to be a pre-departure trajectory effect,
  not a property of any arbitrary window in an active project's history, and the prior iteration's placebo result (coefficient
  -164.5, p=1.0) is itself ambiguous (possibly real null, possibly quasi-separation) and needs a numerically stable re-estimate
  (Firth) before it can be interpreted either way. stratified_robustness directly operationalizes the 'popularity/size doesn't
  explain it' half of the hypothesis (mirroring Avelino et al.'s own d=0.13-0.26 snapshot-covariate null) by checking the
  diffusion signal is not concentrated in one language or star tier. calibration matters because a coefficient can be non-significant
  yet still discriminate reasonably (or vice versa: significant yet useless for ranking), and AUC/Brier with bootstrap CIs
  at this small n communicate the honest uncertainty in both directions rather than a single point estimate that overstates
  precision. power_sensitivity_analysis is the artifact's core new contribution relative to what was already run: it converts
  the vague 'this is probably underpowered' read of iteration 1 into an exact, defensible number (MDE vs observed effect,
  and required-n vs achieved-n), which is exactly what the paper needs to state whether the scaled corpus closed the gap,
  narrowed it by a knowable amount, or actually crossed into significance -- and it gives the next iteration's corpus-scaling
  target a number grounded in the ACTUAL observed effect size and variance rather than a re-guessed target.

title: GitHub Founder-Departure Commit Corpus
summary: >-
  Built from 121 real GitHub repositories sampled via the GitHub REST search API across JavaScript/Python/Java/Go and 3 popularity
  strata (100-1k, 1k-10k, 10k+ stars), each fully cloned locally (git clone --bare) and mined with `git log --numstat` for
  complete per-commit, per-file authorship history (no GitHub API rate-limit bottleneck on commit-level data). A filter funnel
  (documented in temp/funnel_report.json) reduced these to 34 'founder-only TFDD candidate' repos meeting: >=100 total commits,
  no history-loss/squash artifact (no single commit touching >90% of all files ever seen), and a single author holding >=70%
  share of commits in the first ~50-commit/6-month window. Author aliases are resolved via GitHub's `<id>+<login>@users.noreply.github.com`
  pattern and exact email/name matching; repos with >20% bot/generic-email commits are flagged via `metadata_alias_ambiguous_repo`.
  Each of the 70,260 output examples is one (commit, file) row: `input` is a JSON string of observable commit/file-change
  features (commit index, days since repo creation, file path/extension, lines added/removed, is_creation, repo stars/forks/language)
  with author identity withheld; `output` is the 'founder'/'other' authorship label; `metadata_*` fields carry repo_id, full_name,
  license, repo_created_at, commit_sha, commit_timestamp, author_alias_key/email/name, the dominant-founder first-window share,
  and the alias-ambiguity flag. Repos with more than 4000 rows are systematically strided down to that cap (every Nth row,
  chronological order preserved) to keep multi-year histories from a few huge repos (e.g. jenkinsci/jenkins, langchain-ai/langchain)
  from dominating the corpus and to respect the size budget. Final scope (34 repos, 4 languages) is a documented reduced-scope
  fallback from the 150-250/6-language target: GitHub's unauthenticated search API caps at 10 req/min and repo cloning is
  network/time bound, so language and strata breadth were narrowed to what fit the time budget while still meeting the single-founder-start,
  >=100-commit, and non-artifact filters. Known limitation: `days_since_repo_created` can be negative for repos whose GitHub
  creation date postdates their earliest preserved commit (e.g. imported from another VCS with original timestamps kept) --
  this is a genuine provenance quirk of GitHub metadata, not a pipeline bug, and downstream users should be aware some repos
  carry pre-GitHub-import history. Validated against the exp_sel_data_out.json schema; full_data_out.json is 75MB (under the
  100MB per-file and 300MB total caps).

title: Does Founder Authority Diffusion Predict OSS Survival?
summary: >-
  Re-implements Avelino et al.'s (ESEM 2019) Degree-of-Authorship (DOA) / Truck-Factor (TF) / Truck-Factor-Developer-Departure
  (TFDD) / Active-Inactive survival pipeline directly from real GitHub commit histories via the GitHub REST search API and
  `git log --numstat` history walks (no mocked or synthetic data). Sampled 270 candidate repositories across 6 languages (Python,
  JavaScript, Go, Ruby, Java, C++) stratified by popularity tier; 69 survived the age/size filters and were fully processed
  (clone -> per-file DOA snapshots -> yearly Truck-Factor sets -> TFDD detection). Detected 16 strict founder-only (TF=1)
  TFDD events and 20 relaxed (TF<=2) TFDD events. Unconditioned 18-month post-TFDD survival rate was 31.25% (strict) / 45%
  (relaxed), in the same neighborhood as Avelino et al.'s reported ~41%, cross-validating the DOA/TF/TFDD re-implementation.
  The new contribution (our_method) is a pre-departure authority-diffusion trajectory computed in the 12-to-6-month window
  before each TFDD event: founder_share (fraction of window commits made by the founder) and n_diffused_owners (count of independent
  non-founder DOA file-owners at window end). This is compared against Avelino et al.'s own approach (baseline): snapshot
  size/popularity covariates (stars, forks, developer count) measured AT the TFDD event with no temporal trajectory information.
  Both are fit as BH-corrected logistic regressions on the same 16-event strict sample, plus a within-repo placebo/falsification
  check that recomputes the same diffusion metrics on a random non-TFDD-adjacent window (15/16 events had a valid placebo
  window) to test whether the signal is specific to the pre-departure period rather than a generic property of any window.
  A matched-pairs bootstrap risk-ratio design (stars/forks/language-bucketed low-diffusion vs high-diffusion event pairs)
  was also implemented per the plan but found 0 matchable pairs at this sample size (n_pairs=0, risk_ratio=NaN) and is reported
  honestly as inconclusive at this scale rather than fabricated. In the realized logistic fit, our_method's founder_share
  coefficient is negative (-5.56, i.e. higher founder commit-share pre-departure associates with lower survival) and n_diffused_owners
  is also negative (-0.17) in this small sample, but neither survives BH correction at n=16 (BH p>0.6 for all covariates in
  both our_method and the baseline); pseudo-R^2 is 0.175 (our_method) vs 0.211 (baseline snapshot-only), so the baseline explains
  marginally more deviance in this small realized sample. The placebo regression on random non-TFDD windows shows a much larger,
  non-significant coefficient on placebo_founder_share (-164.5, p=1.0), consistent with the placebo metric being poorly identified
  in a non-TFDD-adjacent window rather than a real effect. All numbers here are the genuine output of one completed pipeline
  run (906.7s wall-clock) with no placeholders; the honest headline is that with only 16 founder-only TFDD events the study
  is underpowered to detect a significant BH-corrected effect, and this is reported transparently (raw coefficients, p-values,
  and both BH-corrected and uncorrected results are all present in the output) rather than oversold. method.py implements
  Stages 0-9 exactly as specified in the artifact plan: GitHub API sampling with popularity stratification, exclusion-criteria
  filtering (age/size/fork), `git log --numstat` commit-history extraction, the Fritz-et-al DOA formula (3.293 + 1.098*FA
  - 0.164*sqrt(AC) + 0.230*ln(1+DL)), greedy Truck-Factor-set computation, yearly TFDD scanning with a 1-year silence threshold,
  both strict (TF=1) and relaxed (TF<=2) TFDD detection reported separately, 12-to-6-month pre-departure diffusion metrics,
  18-month post-TFDD Active/Inactive survival labeling, a within-repo placebo window falsification check, matched-pairs bootstrap
  risk-ratio, and BH-corrected logistic regression for both our_method and the baseline, with all per-event rows preserved
  in method_out.json (16 example rows under the exp_gen_sol_out schema, `dataset='founder_authority_diffusion_tfdd_survival'`,
  `input`=repo/founder identity JSON, `output`=full event record JSON, plus `predict_our_method_survived_prob` and `predict_baseline_survived_prob`
  per-example predicted probabilities). Full/mini/preview variants were generated and both files (21KB) are far under the
  100MB size-limit threshold, so no splitting was required. Downstream GEN_PAPER_TEXT should present this as a genuine re-implementation
  validated against Avelino et al.'s published survival rate, with the new pre-departure diffusion signal reported as a directionally-consistent
  but not-yet-statistically-significant finding at n=16, and should NOT claim the matched-pairs risk-ratio result since it
  produced 0 matched pairs at this scale.

Avoid re-training or re-executing the method unless absolutely necessary; prefer loading predictions from each dependency's method_out.json / predict_* fields. Read domain handbook if applicable (see <available_domain_handbooks>). Decide evaluation metrics based on artifact plan. Test basic functionality with 'uv run'.
TODO 3. Fully implement evaluation as described in artifact plan in './eval.py'. Use exp_eval_sol_out.json schema in aii-json skill for output format validation. Include everything specified in the artifact plan, but you may also implement additional relevant metrics or analysis beyond what's listed. Be very attentive to meticulously and exhaustively fix any errors in your code.

name: aii-long-running-tasks
description: "Scales an experiment or evaluation up in stages — mini, 10, 50, 100, 200, then the largest run that fits — recording runtime at each step and extrapolating time-per-example against the remaining time budget before growing further, with background execution and hard RLIMIT_AS and RLIMIT_CPU caps. ALWAYS read before launching any script expected to run for many minutes or hours over a dataset. Triggers: long-running job, overnight or unattended run, time budget, how many examples fit, extrapolate runtime, start small then scale up, run in background and poll, avoid a timeout, full-dataset evaluation, resource limits. NOT for choosing the concurrency mechanism itself (aii-parallel-computing), measuring the machine's CPU, RAM or GPU (aii-use-hardware), or provisioning cloud pods (aii-runpod)."
---

## Core Principles

1. **Time budget first**: Read your time/runtime constraints before running anything. Set every Bash timeout to fit within the budget.
2. **Start small, scale up**: Run on minimal input first, fix errors, then increase scale.
3. **Extrapolate before scaling**: Use recorded runtimes to predict whether the next step fits in the budget. Don't guess — calculate.
4. **Background execution**: For anything that takes >1 min, run in background (`run_in_background=true`) and do useful work while waiting.
5. **Stop early if needed**: Quality results on less data beats a timeout or crash. It's always acceptable to stop at a smaller scale.

---

## Gradual Scaling Sequence

Run code at increasing data sizes, checking runtime at each step.

Substitute your actual file names:
- `{mini_file}` — mini JSON (3 examples) from dependency workspace
- `{full_file}` — full dataset from dependency workspace
- `{script}` — your processing script (e.g., `./method.py`, `./eval.py`)
- `{schema}` — JSON schema to validate output against

**STEP 1 — MINI DATA:** Run `{script}` on `{mini_file}`. Do NOT truncate logs. Fix all errors. Validate output against `{schema}`. Verify you are NOT using mock scripts, mock data, or mock APIs.

**STEP 2 — 10 EXAMPLES:** Modify `{script}` to load only the first 10 examples from `{full_file}`. Run and fix errors. Validate schema. Record the runtime.

**STEP 3 — 50 EXAMPLES:** Load first 50 examples from `{full_file}`. Run and fix errors. Record runtime. **EXTRAPOLATE**: Using runtimes from steps 2-3, estimate time per example. Calculate how many examples fit in your remaining time budget. If 50 already used most of the budget, stop here.

**STEP 4 — 100 EXAMPLES (if budget allows):** Load first 100 examples. Run and fix errors. Record runtime. Re-extrapolate with the new data point.

**STEP 5 — 200 EXAMPLES (if budget allows):** Load first 200 examples from `{full_file}`. Run and fix errors. Record runtime.

**STEP 6 — MAXIMIZE:** Using all recorded runtimes, extrapolate time-per-example (it may not be perfectly linear — account for overhead). Calculate the maximum number of examples that fits within your remaining time budget with a 10% safety margin. Load that many (or all if they fit). Run and validate.

## Final Testing Phase

After completing the scaling sequence, redo the entire sequence **one more time** up to your final example count:

mini → 10 → 50 → 100 → 200 → max

At each scale: look for issues, fix problems, validate output, ensure it completes within time limits.

---

## Background Execution

For any step that takes >1 min, run as a **background task**:

1. Launch with Bash `run_in_background=true`
2. While it runs, use the time productively:
   - Sanity-check previous outputs
   - Verify file integrity (correct field names, non-empty values)
   - Review code for edge cases at larger scale
   - Prepare the next step
3. Check back on the background task to get results
4. If it failed, fix errors and re-run

---

## Resource Limits

Set hard RAM and CPU time limits so code fails fast instead of crashing the system. Read limits from `<hardware>` and leave headroom for the OS (e.g., if 16GB total, cap at 14GB).

Python example using stdlib `resource` module:
```python
import resource
resource.setrlimit(resource.RLIMIT_AS, (14 * 1024**3, 14 * 1024**3))  # 14GB RAM
resource.setrlimit(resource.RLIMIT_CPU, (3600, 3600))  # 1 hour CPU time
```
Exceeding RAM raises `MemoryError`. Exceeding CPU time sends `SIGKILL`.

## Monitoring

At each step, record runtime AND check resource usage (`free -h` for RAM, `top -bn1 | head -5` for CPU). If memory usage is climbing toward the limit or CPU is pegged, stop and investigate before scaling further.

description: "Splits an oversized generated output file into numbered parts that each fit a size limit: checks sizes with ls -lh, writes full_data_out_1.json, full_data_out_2.json and so on into a matching directory, deletes the original, repoints the reading code at a sorted glob, and regenerates mini and preview variants per part. ALWAYS run right after a script writes JSON output, and whenever a file is too big to keep, exceeds a stated file size limit, or gets rejected for its size. Triggers: file too large, output exceeds the size limit, oversized or huge JSON, ls -lh size check after generating results, splitting or chunking an output file into parts, output directory instead of one file. NOT for: schema validation or making mini and preview variants of a file already within the limit (use aii-json), or general Python script conventions (use aii-python)."
---

## File Size Check

After generating output files, run `ls -lh` to check sizes. If ANY file exceeds the provided file size limit:

1. Create directory with same base name (e.g., `data_out/` for `full_data_out.json`)
2. Split into parts under the limit named: `full_data_out_1.json`, `full_data_out_2.json`, etc.
3. Place parts in directory (e.g., `data_out/full_data_out_1.json`, `data_out/full_data_out_2.json`)
4. Delete the original oversized file
5. Update the script to read from split files: `for f in sorted(glob.glob('data_out/full_data_out_*.json')): data.extend(json.load(open(f)))`
6. For each split part, generate its own mini/preview versions with the json skill's format script

name: aii-use-hardware
description: "Detects the CPU, RAM, GPU and VRAM actually available — cgroup v1 and v2 container quotas and CPU affinity rather than misleading host values — then sets RAM and VRAM budgets via resource.setrlimit and torch.cuda.set_per_process_memory_fraction so a script raises a catchable error instead of being OOM-killed, and picks the right torch wheel for the detected device. ALWAYS read before loading a large dataset, installing torch, or sizing batches and worker counts. Triggers: how much RAM or CPU or GPU is available, container memory limit, cgroup, OOM killed, MemoryError, os.cpu_count reports host cores, nproc, VRAM, CUDA available, CPU-only torch build, dataset too big for memory, chunking. NOT for spreading work across that hardware once measured (aii-parallel-computing), staged scale-up runs against a time budget (aii-long-running-tasks), or renting cloud machines (aii-runpod)."
---

**Step 1** — Run `bash scripts/get_hardware.sh` (relative to this skill's directory).

Read the `=== CGROUP ===` section carefully. If `Type: cgroup v1` or `cgroup v2`:
- You are in a **container with hard resource limits**. Exceeding them = OOM kill, no recovery.
- **Never** use `psutil.virtual_memory().total`, `free -h`, `/proc/meminfo`, `os.cpu_count()`, or `nproc` for resource limits — these report **host** values, not your container's allocation.
- **Always** read limits from the cgroup paths shown in the output, or use the Python helpers below.
- For **runtime memory monitoring**, read current usage from cgroup too:
  - v2: `/sys/fs/cgroup/memory.current`
  - v1: `/sys/fs/cgroup/memory/memory.usage_in_bytes`

**Step 2** — Use Step 1 results to pick package variants **before** installing.

Defaults often target the most powerful environment — PyPI's `torch` ships with CUDA libs even on CPU-only hosts. Wrong variant = wasted disk, slow setup, possible import-time failures.

If `=== GPU ===` shows `No GPU`, install torch's CPU build (skips ~4.5GB of CUDA libs):
```bash
uv pip install torch --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
```
Same idea for any library whose wheel selection depends on detected hardware (GPU/CPU-only builds, architecture-specific wheels).

After install, sanity-check imports right away (`python -c "import torch"`). Disk-pressure or interrupted installs leave half-built wheels (e.g. `libtorch_global_deps.so` missing) — catch these before the experiment runs.

**Step 3** — Set Python constants from the Step 1 results:
```python
import os, math, torch, psutil
from pathlib import Path

def _detect_cpus() -> int:
    """Detect actual CPU allocation (containers/pods/bare metal)."""
    try:  # cgroups v2 quota
        parts = Path("/sys/fs/cgroup/cpu.max").read_text().split()
        if parts[0] != "max":
            return math.ceil(int(parts[0]) / int(parts[1]))
    except (FileNotFoundError, ValueError): pass
    try:  # cgroups v1 quota
        q = int(Path("/sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/cpu.cfs_quota_us").read_text())
        p = int(Path("/sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/cpu.cfs_period_us").read_text())
        if q > 0:
            return math.ceil(q / p)
    except (FileNotFoundError, ValueError): pass
    try:  # CPU affinity (cpuset — used by RunPod, Docker --cpuset-cpus)
        return len(os.sched_getaffinity(0))
    except (AttributeError, OSError): pass
    return os.cpu_count() or 1

def _container_ram_gb() -> float | None:
    """Read RAM limit from cgroup (containers/pods)."""
    for p in ["/sys/fs/cgroup/memory.max", "/sys/fs/cgroup/memory/memory.limit_in_bytes"]:
        try:
            v = Path(p).read_text().strip()
            if v != "max" and int(v) < 1_000_000_000_000:
                return int(v) / 1e9
        except (FileNotFoundError, ValueError): pass
    return None

NUM_CPUS = _detect_cpus()
HAS_GPU = torch.cuda.is_available()
VRAM_GB = torch.cuda.get_device_properties(0).total_mem / 1e9 if HAS_GPU else 0
DEVICE = torch.device("cuda" if HAS_GPU else "cpu")
TOTAL_RAM_GB = _container_ram_gb() or psutil.virtual_memory().total / 1e9
AVAILABLE_RAM_GB = min(psutil.virtual_memory().available / 1e9, TOTAL_RAM_GB)
```

## Step 4 — Set Memory Limits

OOM kills the entire container. **Every script MUST set RAM and VRAM limits at startup.**

Decide the budget based on what the script actually needs. Estimate data size × 2-5x for in-memory overhead, then add ~50% breathing room for temporaries. You may use up to 90% of available RAM/VRAM, but **scale gradually** — start small (e.g. 30-50%), verify it works, then increase toward the limit. Never exceed 90% to keep a buffer for the OS, system processes, and the agent runtime itself. Going over crashes the container/machine with no recovery.

```python
import resource, psutil

_avail = psutil.virtual_memory().available
RAM_BUDGET = ???  # YOU decide: estimate what this script needs (in bytes)
assert RAM_BUDGET < _avail, f"Budget {RAM_BUDGET/1e9:.1f}GB > available {_avail/1e9:.1f}GB"
resource.setrlimit(resource.RLIMIT_AS, (RAM_BUDGET * 3, RAM_BUDGET * 3))  # 3x: virtual > RSS; raises MemoryError on exceed

if HAS_GPU:
    _free, _total = torch.cuda.mem_get_info(0)
    VRAM_BUDGET = ???  # YOU decide: estimate GPU memory needs
    torch.cuda.set_per_process_memory_fraction(min(VRAM_BUDGET / _total, 0.95))  # raises OutOfMemoryError on exceed
```

## Memory-Safe Data Processing

- **One at a time**: load one large object → process → `del obj; gc.collect()` → next
- **Load only what you need**: select specific tables/columns/rows, not entire databases
- **Test small first**: run on a sample before scaling to full data to estimate memory/time
- **Free intermediates in loops**: don't accumulate large results — aggregate incrementally
- **Size before loading**: check file/dataset size before loading; if it's >30% of `RAM_BUDGET`, chunk it

## Common Mistakes (from real crashes)

- **Skipping this skill entirely** — loading data with no RAM detection, no limits, no budget. Container OOM-killed, all agents lost.
- **Using `psutil.virtual_memory().total` instead of `_container_ram_gb()`** — reports host RAM (e.g. 66 GB) when container limit is 28 GB. You MUST use the cgroup-aware functions above.
- **Loading all tables from a multi-table database at once** — one agent loaded 14 RelBench tables simultaneously, spiked past container limit.
- **Setting no memory limits** — without `resource.setrlimit` (RAM) and `set_per_process_memory_fraction` (VRAM), a runaway script OOM-kills the container instead of raising a catchable error.
- **Using `os.cpu_count()` directly** — returns host CPUs (e.g. 192) instead of container limit (e.g. 4) on RunPod/Docker. Always use `_detect_cpus()` above which checks cgroup quota → CPU affinity → `os.cpu_count()` in order.

## Hardware Use

- Keep these results in mind for ALL subsequent tasks — don't assume more than detected
- GPU if available and parallelizable, multiprocessing if multiple CPUs
- Push available resources to their full potential — don't leave hardware idle

The agent loaded the **aii-parallel-computing** skill; its `SKILL.md` (the instructions injected into the agent's context) follows verbatim.

````

name: aii-parallel-computing
description: "Parallelises compute-heavy Python: asyncio with aiohttp and a bounded Semaphore for I/O-bound work, ProcessPoolExecutor under the spawn start method for CPU-bound work, NumPy vectorisation and batched PyTorch on GPU with an out-of-memory halving fallback. ALWAYS read before writing any script that loops over data, issues many API calls, downloads many files, or runs heavy computation — sequential loops are the default failure mode. Triggers: parallelise, make a slow script faster, concurrency, async, aiohttp, asyncio.gather, semaphore, multiprocessing, ProcessPoolExecutor, fork deadlock with loguru, worker count, batch size, CUDA out of memory, idle GPU, retries and rate limits. NOT for detecting what hardware exists or setting RAM and VRAM budgets (aii-use-hardware), staged scale-up against a time budget (aii-long-running-tasks), or provisioning cloud pods (aii-runpod)."
---

**ALWAYS parallelize. Sequential processing is unacceptable for any non-trivial workload.** A sequential script doing 1000 API calls takes hours and fails halfway. An async version finishes in minutes with proper error handling. ALWAYS ask: "Can this run in parallel?" — the answer is almost always yes.

Read aii-use-hardware skill first → get `NUM_CPUS`, `HAS_GPU`, `VRAM_GB`, `device`. Set `NUM_WORKERS` proportional to available CPU capacity — check `psutil.cpu_percent(interval=1)` and scale accordingly (e.g. 30% used → use ~70% of cores).

## Decision Tree (follow strictly)

- **I/O-bound** (API calls, downloads, web, file reads) → `asyncio` + `aiohttp` with `Semaphore(NUM_WORKERS * 4)`. NEVER do sequential HTTP requests in a loop.
- **CPU-bound, vectorizable** → GPU available: PyTorch on device / No GPU: NumPy vectorized ops. NEVER loop over array elements in Python.
- **CPU-bound, independent items** → `ProcessPoolExecutor(max_workers=NUM_WORKERS)`. NEVER process items one-by-one when they're independent.
- **Sequential** → only acceptable when items have data dependencies (each depends on the previous result).

## GPU Rules

- Use up to 90% of available VRAM — scale gradually (start small, increase after each successful run, keep 10% buffer)
- Move to device → compute → move back: `torch.tensor(data, device=device)` → `.cpu().numpy()`
- OOM fallback: catch `torch.cuda.OutOfMemoryError` → `empty_cache()` → halve batch size → retry on GPU. Keep reducing until it fits. Stay on GPU.
- Batch large data: chunk it, `del batch` between iterations to free VRAM

## Parallelism Rules

- **CPU-bound**: `ProcessPoolExecutor` + `as_completed`, pre-allocate result list indexed by submission order
- **I/O-bound**: `asyncio` + `aiohttp`, `Semaphore(NUM_WORKERS * 4)`, single shared `ClientSession`, `asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)`
- Always add `tenacity` retries for transient failures, always set timeouts on HTTP requests
- **CRITICAL — `ProcessPoolExecutor` start method**: Default `fork` deadlocks with loguru (and any threading library). ALWAYS pass `mp_context=multiprocessing.get_context("spawn")` when constructing `ProcessPoolExecutor` in any script that uses loguru, threading, or async I/O. Example:
  ```python
  import multiprocessing as mp
  from concurrent.futures import ProcessPoolExecutor
  with ProcessPoolExecutor(max_workers=N, mp_context=mp.get_context("spawn")) as pool:
      ...

title: Power Audit of the Founder-Diffusion Survival Test
summary: >-
  Re-run the placebo/falsification and robustness evaluation against the completed 69-repo/16-20-event scaled experiment output
  (art_4CZ-9Ou1G5ty), fixing the prior race condition by making eval strictly wait on the experiment's full method_out.json
  write, and add a formal power/minimum-detectable-effect analysis so the paper can state exactly how underpowered the n=16-20
  result is rather than describing it qualitatively.
runpod_compute_profile: gpu
metrics_descriptions: >-
  eval_out.json reports six blocks, computed by loading full_method_out.json from the experiment dependency (verified complete
  via a file-mtime/JSON-parse sanity check before any stats run, to avoid the previously disclosed race condition -- if the
  file is truncated or missing expected keys, the eval script must fail loudly rather than silently scoring a partial file).
  (1) pipeline_validity: unconditioned survival rate for strict (TF=1, n=16) and relaxed (TF<=2, n=20) TFDD sets, each with
  a Wilson/Clopper-Pearson 95% CI, compared against Avelino et al.'s published 41% (128/315) reference rate via a one-sample
  proportion z-test/exact binomial test -- this is a sanity check that the re-implemented DOA/TF/TFDD pipeline is not systematically
  biased, not a test of the hypothesis itself. (2) primary_regression: re-extract (not re-derive from scratch -- reuse method.py's
  already-implemented BH-corrected logistic regression code path) the founder_share and n_diffused_owners coefficients, their
  standard errors, raw p-values, and BH-adjusted q-values, for both our_method and the baseline snapshot-covariate model,
  on both the strict-16 and relaxed-20 samples (relaxed-20 is new: it was not the primary analysis in the prior iteration,
  so this doubles as a same-pipeline cross-check on the strict result -- report whether direction and rough magnitude replicate).
  (3) placebo_test: recompute the within-repo placebo-window regression coefficient on placebo_founder_share/placebo_n_diffused_owners
  (15/16 valid windows) and formally compare it to the real pre-departure coefficient using a Wald-type contrast (or, if the
  model is unstable as the -164.5-coefficient/p=1.0 result from the prior iteration suggests separation, report the placebo
  fit's separation diagnostic (e.g. via Firth penalized logistic regression to get a finite estimate) rather than an uninterpretable
  near-infinite coefficient) -- the criterion for 'placebo confirms specificity' is that the placebo coefficient's CI does
  not exclude 0 while overlapping/being materially closer to 0 than the real-window coefficient. (4) stratified_robustness:
  survival rate and, where n permits (>=3 events per cell), the founder_share coefficient sign, broken out by language (Python/JS/Go/Ruby/Java/C++)
  and by the 3 popularity strata (100-1k/1k-10k/10k+ stars) -- for any stratum cell with <3 events, report the raw counts
  and explicitly mark the cell 'insufficient_n' rather than computing a statistic that would be spurious. (5) calibration:
  bootstrap (1000 resamples, stratified by survival outcome to keep both classes represented in every resample given n=16-20)
  95% CIs on the AUC and Brier score of predict_our_method_survived_prob and predict_baseline_survived_prob already present
  in method_out.json, plus a calibration-in-the-large check (mean predicted vs observed survival rate). (6) power_sensitivity_analysis
  (the new component this artifact adds beyond re-running prior logic): using the achieved n (16 and 20), the observed covariate
  variance (e.g. SD of founder_share and n_diffused_owners across the realized sample), and a two-sided alpha=0.05 with BH
  correction for 2 tests, compute via statsmodels' power module (GLM/logistic power approximated by mapping the logistic coefficient
  to an equivalent-information Wald test, or via a Monte Carlo simulation: simulate 5000 synthetic datasets at the observed
  covariate distribution and a grid of true effect sizes, fit the same logistic model, and find the smallest effect size at
  which power=0.80) the minimum detectable odds ratio (MDE) at 80% power for each of founder_share and n_diffused_owners,
  then report the ratio of the OBSERVED coefficient magnitude to that MDE (e.g. 'observed founder_share OR-equivalent is 0.34x
  the MDE at 80% power' or 'X% of target power achieved') as a single, precise, citable number replacing the prior iteration's
  qualitative '40-50% of target' claim; separately report the n required to reach 80% power at the observed effect size, and
  its ratio to the original power-analysis target (~40 events) and to the achieved n (16-20), so the corpus-scaling gap is
  quantified in both directions (effect-size-fixed-solve-for-n AND n-fixed-solve-for-detectable-effect).
metrics_justification: >-
  The hypothesis's central claim (pre-departure diffusion predicts survival) was left explicitly open after iteration 1 --
  directionally consistent but not BH-significant at n=16-20 -- so the two things this evaluation must nail down are (a) whether
  that null is a genuine null or an artifact of the previously disclosed race condition / an unfinished experiment write,
  and (b) precisely how underpowered n=16-20 is, since 'underpowered' without a number is unfalsifiable and cannot tell a
  future iteration whether 40, 100, or 300 events are actually needed. pipeline_validity anchors the whole evaluation to Avelino
  et al.'s published rate so a reviewer can trust the re-implementation before trusting anything built on top of it. placebo_test
  is the artifact's specificity check: the hypothesis requires the diffusion signal to be a pre-departure trajectory effect,
  not a property of any arbitrary window in an active project's history, and the prior iteration's placebo result (coefficient
  -164.5, p=1.0) is itself ambiguous (possibly real null, possibly quasi-separation) and needs a numerically stable re-estimate
  (Firth) before it can be interpreted either way. stratified_robustness directly operationalizes the 'popularity/size doesn't
  explain it' half of the hypothesis (mirroring Avelino et al.'s own d=0.13-0.26 snapshot-covariate null) by checking the
  diffusion signal is not concentrated in one language or star tier. calibration matters because a coefficient can be non-significant
  yet still discriminate reasonably (or vice versa: significant yet useless for ranking), and AUC/Brier with bootstrap CIs
  at this small n communicate the honest uncertainty in both directions rather than a single point estimate that overstates
  precision. power_sensitivity_analysis is the artifact's core new contribution relative to what was already run: it converts
  the vague 'this is probably underpowered' read of iteration 1 into an exact, defensible number (MDE vs observed effect,
  and required-n vs achieved-n), which is exactly what the paper needs to state whether the scaled corpus closed the gap,
  narrowed it by a knowable amount, or actually crossed into significance -- and it gives the next iteration's corpus-scaling
  target a number grounded in the ACTUAL observed effect size and variance rather than a re-guessed target.

title: GitHub Founder-Departure Commit Corpus
summary: >-
  Built from 121 real GitHub repositories sampled via the GitHub REST search API across JavaScript/Python/Java/Go and 3 popularity
  strata (100-1k, 1k-10k, 10k+ stars), each fully cloned locally (git clone --bare) and mined with `git log --numstat` for
  complete per-commit, per-file authorship history (no GitHub API rate-limit bottleneck on commit-level data). A filter funnel
  (documented in temp/funnel_report.json) reduced these to 34 'founder-only TFDD candidate' repos meeting: >=100 total commits,
  no history-loss/squash artifact (no single commit touching >90% of all files ever seen), and a single author holding >=70%
  share of commits in the first ~50-commit/6-month window. Author aliases are resolved via GitHub's `<id>+<login>@users.noreply.github.com`
  pattern and exact email/name matching; repos with >20% bot/generic-email commits are flagged via `metadata_alias_ambiguous_repo`.
  Each of the 70,260 output examples is one (commit, file) row: `input` is a JSON string of observable commit/file-change
  features (commit index, days since repo creation, file path/extension, lines added/removed, is_creation, repo stars/forks/language)
  with author identity withheld; `output` is the 'founder'/'other' authorship label; `metadata_*` fields carry repo_id, full_name,
  license, repo_created_at, commit_sha, commit_timestamp, author_alias_key/email/name, the dominant-founder first-window share,
  and the alias-ambiguity flag. Repos with more than 4000 rows are systematically strided down to that cap (every Nth row,
  chronological order preserved) to keep multi-year histories from a few huge repos (e.g. jenkinsci/jenkins, langchain-ai/langchain)
  from dominating the corpus and to respect the size budget. Final scope (34 repos, 4 languages) is a documented reduced-scope
  fallback from the 150-250/6-language target: GitHub's unauthenticated search API caps at 10 req/min and repo cloning is
  network/time bound, so language and strata breadth were narrowed to what fit the time budget while still meeting the single-founder-start,
  >=100-commit, and non-artifact filters. Known limitation: `days_since_repo_created` can be negative for repos whose GitHub
  creation date postdates their earliest preserved commit (e.g. imported from another VCS with original timestamps kept) --
  this is a genuine provenance quirk of GitHub metadata, not a pipeline bug, and downstream users should be aware some repos
  carry pre-GitHub-import history. Validated against the exp_sel_data_out.json schema; full_data_out.json is 75MB (under the
  100MB per-file and 300MB total caps).

title: Does Founder Authority Diffusion Predict OSS Survival?
summary: >-
  Re-implements Avelino et al.'s (ESEM 2019) Degree-of-Authorship (DOA) / Truck-Factor (TF) / Truck-Factor-Developer-Departure
  (TFDD) / Active-Inactive survival pipeline directly from real GitHub commit histories via the GitHub REST search API and
  `git log --numstat` history walks (no mocked or synthetic data). Sampled 270 candidate repositories across 6 languages (Python,
  JavaScript, Go, Ruby, Java, C++) stratified by popularity tier; 69 survived the age/size filters and were fully processed
  (clone -> per-file DOA snapshots -> yearly Truck-Factor sets -> TFDD detection). Detected 16 strict founder-only (TF=1)
  TFDD events and 20 relaxed (TF<=2) TFDD events. Unconditioned 18-month post-TFDD survival rate was 31.25% (strict) / 45%
  (relaxed), in the same neighborhood as Avelino et al.'s reported ~41%, cross-validating the DOA/TF/TFDD re-implementation.
  The new contribution (our_method) is a pre-departure authority-diffusion trajectory computed in the 12-to-6-month window
  before each TFDD event: founder_share (fraction of window commits made by the founder) and n_diffused_owners (count of independent
  non-founder DOA file-owners at window end). This is compared against Avelino et al.'s own approach (baseline): snapshot
  size/popularity covariates (stars, forks, developer count) measured AT the TFDD event with no temporal trajectory information.
  Both are fit as BH-corrected logistic regressions on the same 16-event strict sample, plus a within-repo placebo/falsification
  check that recomputes the same diffusion metrics on a random non-TFDD-adjacent window (15/16 events had a valid placebo
  window) to test whether the signal is specific to the pre-departure period rather than a generic property of any window.
  A matched-pairs bootstrap risk-ratio design (stars/forks/language-bucketed low-diffusion vs high-diffusion event pairs)
  was also implemented per the plan but found 0 matchable pairs at this sample size (n_pairs=0, risk_ratio=NaN) and is reported
  honestly as inconclusive at this scale rather than fabricated. In the realized logistic fit, our_method's founder_share
  coefficient is negative (-5.56, i.e. higher founder commit-share pre-departure associates with lower survival) and n_diffused_owners
  is also negative (-0.17) in this small sample, but neither survives BH correction at n=16 (BH p>0.6 for all covariates in
  both our_method and the baseline); pseudo-R^2 is 0.175 (our_method) vs 0.211 (baseline snapshot-only), so the baseline explains
  marginally more deviance in this small realized sample. The placebo regression on random non-TFDD windows shows a much larger,
  non-significant coefficient on placebo_founder_share (-164.5, p=1.0), consistent with the placebo metric being poorly identified
  in a non-TFDD-adjacent window rather than a real effect. All numbers here are the genuine output of one completed pipeline
  run (906.7s wall-clock) with no placeholders; the honest headline is that with only 16 founder-only TFDD events the study
  is underpowered to detect a significant BH-corrected effect, and this is reported transparently (raw coefficients, p-values,
  and both BH-corrected and uncorrected results are all present in the output) rather than oversold. method.py implements
  Stages 0-9 exactly as specified in the artifact plan: GitHub API sampling with popularity stratification, exclusion-criteria
  filtering (age/size/fork), `git log --numstat` commit-history extraction, the Fritz-et-al DOA formula (3.293 + 1.098*FA
  - 0.164*sqrt(AC) + 0.230*ln(1+DL)), greedy Truck-Factor-set computation, yearly TFDD scanning with a 1-year silence threshold,
  both strict (TF=1) and relaxed (TF<=2) TFDD detection reported separately, 12-to-6-month pre-departure diffusion metrics,
  18-month post-TFDD Active/Inactive survival labeling, a within-repo placebo window falsification check, matched-pairs bootstrap
  risk-ratio, and BH-corrected logistic regression for both our_method and the baseline, with all per-event rows preserved
  in method_out.json (16 example rows under the exp_gen_sol_out schema, `dataset='founder_authority_diffusion_tfdd_survival'`,
  `input`=repo/founder identity JSON, `output`=full event record JSON, plus `predict_our_method_survived_prob` and `predict_baseline_survived_prob`
  per-example predicted probabilities). Full/mini/preview variants were generated and both files (21KB) are far under the
  100MB size-limit threshold, so no splitting was required. Downstream GEN_PAPER_TEXT should present this as a genuine re-implementation
  validated against Avelino et al.'s published survival rate, with the new pre-departure diffusion signal reported as a directionally-consistent
  but not-yet-statistically-significant finding at n=16, and should NOT claim the matched-pairs risk-ratio result since it
  produced 0 matched pairs at this scale.
