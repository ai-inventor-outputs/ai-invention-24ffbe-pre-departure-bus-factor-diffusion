<ai_inventor_context>
<ai_inventor_summary>
You are one of many LLMs in AI Inventor — an automated research system that generates NOVEL and FEASIBLE hypotheses, investigates them through experiments and research, and produces a paper.

Your output feeds other LLMs downstream. This demands your ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM reasoning — every output must be deeply thought out and maximally useful. Surface-level responses waste downstream computation.
</ai_inventor_summary>

<your_role>
YOU ARE: A plan generator (Step 3.2: GEN_PLAN in the invention loop)

You received the hypothesis, an artifact direction to elaborate, and dependency artifacts relevant to the plan.
Your job: elaborate this direction into a detailed, actionable plan for the executor agent.

Specific, actionable plan → valuable artifact. Vague plan → wasted execution.
</your_role>
</ai_inventor_context>

<artifact_type_info>
You are expanding an artifact direction of type: EVALUATION

EVALUATION
Evaluate experiment results with metrics, statistical analysis, and validity checks.
Runtime: Python 3.12, UV (any evaluation library), isolated workspace, gradual scaling matching experiment.
Tools: Full shell/Python/filesystem access, the aii-web-tools skill (web search, page fetch, regex grep over full page/PDF text), and other skills.
Skills: aii-json (schema validation), aii-openrouter-llms (call any LLM — GPT, Gemini, Llama, etc.), domain-specific as needed.
Capabilities: Compute any quantitative metrics and statistical tests, analyze validity and robustness.
Deps: REQUIRED at least one EXPERIMENT | OPTIONAL DATASET if reference data needed
</artifact_type_info>

<available_resources>
<software_constraints>
- Python only implementation
- Python standard library and all popular PyPI packages available (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, scipy, matplotlib, requests, etc.)
- Local parallelism encouraged: multiprocessing, asyncio, threading — see aii-parallel-computing skill
- LLM API calls must go through OpenRouter only (no direct OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- **SPEND BUDGET**: at most $10 USD of OpenRouter API calls for this artifact. Nothing outside your own code enforces this — the key you are given has no per-artifact cap — so it holds only if you track cumulative cost after every call and stop when you approach it. Budget the work up front: estimate the per-call cost and the number of calls BEFORE starting a sweep, not after it overruns. Exceeding it spends real money that the run cannot recover.

<time_budget>

The evaluation executor has 3h total (including writing code, debugging, testing, and fixing errors).

</time_budget>

<available_tools>
Web research is available through the aii-web-tools skill, in three levels (broad → specific):

1. web search — Returns titles, URLs, snippets. Use first to discover and scan the landscape. Two modes: general (default, broad web) and scholarly (peer-reviewed papers + citations) — pass mode=scholarly for prior-art, related-work, and citation lookups.
2. web fetch — Reads a page and returns its content as markdown (HTML or PDF). Use to understand a source. May miss specific details — use fetch_grep below if it doesn't find what you need.
3. fetch_grep — Regex search over a page/PDF's full text. Returns exact matching sections with context. Use for precise details, exact numbers, methodology, or PDFs.

Workflow: search → fetch (understand) → fetch_grep (extract specifics).
</available_tools>

<tool_use>
Maximize parallel tool calls. Parallelize independent operations, only sequentialize dependencies.
- Multiple searches/fetches on different topics → parallel in one turn
- Search then fetch results → sequential (need URLs first)
</tool_use>

<plan_guidelines>
You are expanding an artifact direction from the strategy into a detailed plan.
The artifact direction specifies what to do at a high level (type, objective, approach, dependencies).
Your job is to make it concrete and actionable as a detailed plan.
Use web research to look up technical details, verify feasibility, and find reference materials
that will make your plan more concrete and actionable for the executor.

GOOD PLANS:
- Make each component SPECIFIC and actionable (not vague platitudes)
- Consider both success AND failure scenarios
- Build on the approach in the artifact direction
- Add concrete details the executor needs

BAD PLANS:
- Vague hand-waving ("do research on X")
- Ignoring the approach in the artifact direction
- Missing critical details the executor needs
</plan_guidelines>

<system_reminder>
Do not ask follow up questions and do not ask the user anything. Execute all steps independently.
You must follow the todo list provided in each prompt exactly as written.
No placeholders, stubs, or incomplete code — all code must be complete and functional.
</system_reminder>

<process_isolation>
CRITICAL: Multiple pipeline runs may execute simultaneously on this machine. `ps aux | grep method.py` matches ALL runs, not just yours.
- NEVER kill processes by name (`killall`, `pkill -f`, `ps aux | grep ... | xargs kill`). This kills OTHER runs' processes.
- NEVER monitor processes by name (`ps aux | grep method.py`). You will see other runs' processes and get confused.
- ALWAYS use PID-based process management:
  Run: `uv run method.py & PID=$!` or `timeout <seconds> uv run method.py & PID=$!`
  Check: `kill -0 $PID 2>/dev/null && echo "Running" || echo "Ended"`
  Stop: `kill $PID`
  Wait: `wait $PID; echo "Exit code: $?"`
  Monitor: `tail -f logs/run.log & TAIL_PID=$!` then `kill $TAIL_PID` when done
</process_isolation>

kind: hypothesis
title: Measuring Pre-Departure Authority Diffusion in OSS Projects
hypothesis: >-
  A calibrated reimplementation of Avelino et al.'s (ESEM 2019) DOA/Truck-Factor/TFDD pipeline, extended with a NEW pre-departure
  authority-diffusion measurement (founder commit-share and count of distinct non-founder DOA file-owners in the 6-12 months
  before a founder-only Truck-Factor Detachment), can (a) reproduce Avelino et al.'s published headline statistics closely
  enough to trust the reimplementation, and (b) show this new diffusion measurement is temporally specific to the pre-departure
  window rather than a generic property of active projects, measured via a permutation test with an explicitly reported, sufficiently
  fine-grained permutation scheme. On a 15-repository convenience corpus built by starting from currently-famous, still-maintained
  tools, the calibration gate itself demonstrates the corpus is NOT a valid sampling frame for testing the causal diffusion-predicts-survival
  claim: TFDD incidence (53.3% vs Avelino et al.'s 16.3%) and 18-month survival (100% vs their 40.6%) both deviate sharply
  in the direction of severe survivorship bias, because starting from tools known today to still exist necessarily conditions
  on the outcome being predicted. This is a sampling-frame defect, not merely a power shortfall -- a larger sample drawn from
  the same 'currently-famous tools' frame would still be biased toward survivors and would remain unable to test the causal
  claim. The original causal hypothesis (that founder-only-TFDD projects with diffused pre-departure authority survive at
  a higher rate than matched projects with concentrated authority) THEREFORE REMAINS OPEN and is reframed as the target of
  a specific, well-defined follow-up: a corpus constructed from a historical snapshot of GitHub repositories that does NOT
  condition on present-day liveness (e.g. Avelino et al.'s own stratified top-500-per-language-circa-a-fixed-year design,
  extended via the already-built, checkpointed ~104-repository candidate pipeline and an authenticated GitHub token raising
  the query budget ~83x), yielding an estimated ~40 founder-only TFDD events -- the threshold this study's own fallback power
  analysis identifies as needed, and roughly 8x what a non-conditioned corpus of this size (15 repos) would be expected to
  produce. Until that corpus exists, this paper's contribution is the validated measurement instrument and calibration/robustness
  harness (pipeline replication, diagnostic gate, permutation-based construct-validity check for the diffusion measurement)
  plus a precise specification of what a valid test of the causal claim requires -- not an empirical answer to whether diffusion
  predicts survival.
motivation: >-
  The folk narrative around OSS abandonment treats founder departure as an exogenous shock whose outcome is explained after
  the fact by project popularity ('it was big enough to survive') or luck (a 'benevolent dictator' successor happened to appear).
  Avelino et al.'s full-text-verified ESEM 2019 results directly undercut the popularity explanation: at the TFDD snapshot
  itself, surviving and non-surviving projects show no meaningful difference in developers, commits, or files. That leaves
  a genuine open question their paper does not answer — if size doesn't predict survival at the moment of departure, what
  does? This hypothesis proposes that the missing signal is temporal rather than cross-sectional: it lives in the TREND of
  authority concentration in the run-up to departure, not in any single snapshot. If true, this gives foundations (e.g. Apache
  Incubator, NumFOCUS, Software Freedom Conservancy) an actionable, pre-departure-observable predictor — computable from Avelino
  et al.'s own published, validated DOA/TF pipeline run one time-window earlier — rather than only a post-hoc explanation
  of who happened to survive.
assumptions:
- >-
  Founder departure can be operationalized, following Avelino et al.'s validated Truck Factor Developer Detachment (TFDD)
  construct (ESEM 2019), as the point at which every developer in the project's Truck-Factor set (the minimal set of highest-Degree-of-Authorship
  contributors) has gone silent; Avelino et al. empirically selected a 1-year abandoner threshold as the least error-sensitive
  of five candidates they tested (harmonic-mean precision 0.66 vs 0.44-0.64 for the alternatives), which this study reuses
  rather than re-deriving
- >-
  Truck Factor / core-developer status can be computed per year with the Degree-of-Authorship (DOA) algorithm Avelino et al.
  use (also validated against 67 projects in their 2016 ICPC paper), operationalizing 'authority' as file-level primary ownership
  rather than raw commit count
- >-
  Projects included have at least 3 years of history after the identified departure point, so an 18-month post-departure survival
  window can be measured without right-censoring; Avelino et al.'s own dataset required only 2 years of history and required
  manually excluding 'perils of mining GitHub' artifacts (repos that lost history on migration, non-software repos, book/awesome-list
  repos) which this study must also filter
- >-
  Survival is operationalized as a graded outcome from post-departure activity, following Avelino et al.'s Active/Inactive
  state model (a project is Inactive once its full Truck-Factor set has detached, Active again once a new TF developer is
  attracted) rather than any formal declaration of abandonment, since Coelho & Valente (FSE 2017) found the large majority
  of failed projects never post such a declaration (only 76 of their 618 failed projects had an explicit README deprecation
  notice; the rest were identified purely from a >1-year commit silence)
- >-
  The founder's identity and the set of non-founder authority-holders can be disambiguated via the GitHub-API email-to-account
  mapping Avelino et al. used for alias resolution (median 11% of a project's contributors are aliases in their dataset),
  acknowledging their own noted limitation that this does not catch developers with multiple distinct GitHub accounts
investigation_approach: >-
  1. Assemble a corpus in the same spirit as Avelino et al.'s 1,932-project dataset (top-500-starred repos per language across
  6 languages, filtered for mining artifacts and <2-years history), but restricted to the single-founder subset needed here:
  repos with one clearly dominant original committer, sampled across popularity strata to avoid confounding by size. 2. For
  each repo, recompute yearly Truck Factor and TF-developer sets with the DOA algorithm exactly as Avelino et al. specify,
  and identify each project's FIRST TFDD event where the departing TF set is a single founder (TF=1 at detachment) — Avelino
  et al. report 66% of TFDDs in their corpus occur at TF=1, so this founder-only subset is a large, well-populated slice of
  their existing framework, not a rare edge case. 3. NEW measurement, not present in Avelino et al.: for the 6-12 months immediately
  preceding that TFDD, compute the founder's share of merged/authored commits and the count of distinct non-founder accounts
  that had already reached DOA-based file ownership on at least one file, i.e. an authority-diffusion TRAJECTORY leading up
  to the snapshot Avelino et al. only measure AT and AFTER the TFDD. 4. Compute the survival outcome using Avelino et al.'s
  own Active/Inactive/recovery definition (18-month post-TFDD activity, graded thriving/maintained/dormant/dead) so results
  are directly comparable to their reported 41% survival rate. 5. Fit a logistic/ordinal regression and a matched-pairs comparison
  (equal star/fork/contributor-count bucket, differing pre-TFDD authority-diffusion score) predicting survival from pre-departure
  diffusion, controlling for stars, forks, contributor count, language, and license — including the covariates Avelino et
  al. found NOT to differ between survivors and non-survivors at the TFDD snapshot itself (developers, commits, files — negligible-to-small
  effect sizes, d=0.13-0.26) to test whether the pre-departure trend outperforms those snapshot covariates. 6. Falsification
  check: shuffle which 6-12-month window is treated as 'pre-departure' within both survivor and non-survivor groups to confirm
  the effect is specific to the window immediately preceding TFDD and not an artifact of generally-active projects having
  generally-diffused authority throughout their history.
success_criteria: >-
  1. In the matched-pairs comparison (equal size/popularity bucket), founder-TFDD projects with pre-departure founder authorship-share
  below 50% AND >=2 independent non-founder DOA-file-owners survive at a rate at least 1.5x higher than matched projects where
  the founder retained >=80% authorship share up to departure, with a 95% CI that excludes 1x — a real lift over Avelino et
  al.'s unconditioned 41% baseline survival rate for TFDDs generally. 2. In the regression, the authority-diffusion predictors
  (founder authorship-share, distinct pre-departure DOA-owner count) remain statistically significant (p<0.05, Benjamini-Hochberg
  corrected, following Avelino et al.'s own multiple-comparison procedure) after controlling for stars, forks, and contributor
  count, and their standardized effect size exceeds that of the size/popularity covariates Avelino et al. found had only negligible-to-small
  effect (d=0.13 for files, d=0.25-0.26 for developers/commits) at the TFDD snapshot. 3. The placebo/shuffle check shows the
  effect is significantly weaker or absent when the 'pre-departure window' is randomly relocated within the project's history,
  supporting that it is specifically the pre-departure diffusion trajectory — not generally-active projects having generally-diffused
  authority throughout — doing the predictive work.

  Avelino, Constantinou, Valente & Serebrenik, 'On the abandonment and survival of open source projects: An empirical investigation'
  (ESEM 2019, arXiv:1906.08058) — VERIFIED BY FULL-TEXT READ. Mines 1,932 popular GitHub repos, computes yearly Truck Factor
  via the DOA algorithm, and defines TFDD (Truck Factor Developer Detachment) plus an Active/Inactive survival model with
  a validated 1-year abandoner threshold. Reports 315 projects (16%) face a TFDD, 66% of TFDDs occur at TF=1 (single core
  developer), 128/315 (41%) survive their TFDD (usually via a single new TF developer, 86% of cases; newcomers specifically
  drove 48% of recoveries), and at the TFDD snapshot itself surviving vs non-surviving projects show NO meaningful difference
  in developers/commits/files (d=0.13-0.26, negligible-small) while surviving projects are significantly YOUNGER (1095 vs
  1460 days, p=3.4e-7). This is the direct empirical basis this hypothesis builds on and diverges from: Avelino et al. measure
  diffusion/recovery strictly AT and AFTER the TFDD snapshot ('did a new TF developer arrive afterward'), and explicitly do
  not analyze the pre-TFDD trend in authority concentration — their own snapshot-covariate null result (size doesn't predict
  survival) is what motivates testing whether a PRE-departure trajectory succeeds where the snapshot fails.

  Avelino, Ferreira, Valente et al., 'A novel approach for estimating Truck Factor' (ICPC 2016) — the DOA-based TF-estimation
  algorithm reused verbatim by the ESEM 2019 paper and by this proposal; validated against a manual survey of 67 GitHub projects,
  but the original paper only computes TF as a single-time-point risk score and does not connect it longitudinally to post-departure
  survival outcomes.
- >-
  Coelho & Valente, 'Why Modern Open Source Projects Fail' (FSE 2017, arXiv:1707.02327) — VERIFIED BY FULL-TEXT READ. Surveys
  maintainers of 104 curated failed GitHub projects (out of 618 identified failures among the top-5,000 starred repos) and
  reports nine failure reasons grouped into team (lack of time 18, lack of interest 18, conflicts 3), project (obsolete 20,
  outdated tech 14, low maintainability 7), and environment (usurped by competitor 27, legal 2, acquisition 1) causes; also
  finds failed projects adopt far fewer best-practice maintenance signals than top projects (contributing guidelines: 16%
  vs 72%, large effect; CI: 27% vs 68%, medium effect). This is single-maintainer self-reported ABANDONMENT (why did YOU stop),
  a different unit and mechanism from this hypothesis's multi-contributor SUCCESSION question (did authority already exist
  elsewhere before the founder left); it corroborates that pre-existing maintenance-practice signals (correlates of authority
  diffusion, e.g. contributing guidelines) are already known to associate with failure risk, but does not test a specific
  pre-departure diffusion metric or timeline.
- >-
  Zhou & Mockus and related individual-contributor-turnover-prediction literature — models WHICH developer will leave next,
  a related but distinct outcome from this hypothesis's PROJECT-level survival question conditioned on the founder specifically
  having already left.
inspiration: >-
  The inspiration is an analogy to organizational succession research outside software: family businesses and founder-led
  companies are known to survive founder exit better when authority was already delegated to a management team beforehand,
  rather than concentrated with the founder until the moment of transition ('planned succession' vs 'crisis succession').
  Reading Avelino et al.'s full ESEM 2019 paper sharpened this: they build exactly the TFDD/survival measurement machinery
  needed, but report that at the moment of detachment, surviving and non-surviving projects look statistically indistinguishable
  on size (developers, commits, files) — a genuine null result for the 'was it big enough' folk explanation. That null is
  the opening for this hypothesis: if a SNAPSHOT at departure carries no signal, the signal may instead live in the TREND
  of authority concentration in the months leading up to it — not 'how many people could keep this alive right now,' but 'was
  authority already flowing to others before it had to.' This shift from a snapshot metric to a trajectory-of-decentralization
  metric is directly testable by re-running Avelino et al.'s own DOA/TF pipeline one window earlier in time.
terms:
- term: Truck Factor Developer Detachment (TFDD)
  definition: >-
    Avelino et al.'s (ESEM 2019) term for the event at which every developer in a project's current Truck-Factor set has gone
    silent for at least the validated 1-year abandoner threshold; this hypothesis's 'founder departure point' is the specific
    subset of TFDDs where the detaching TF set has size 1 (a single founder), which Avelino et al. report as 66% of all observed
    TFDDs.
- term: Degree of Authorship (DOA)
  definition: >-
    The file-level expertise metric (Fritz et al., reused by Avelino et al.'s TF algorithm) combining whether a developer
    created a file and how many of its subsequent changes are theirs relative to others; a developer is a file's primary author,
    and thus a candidate Truck-Factor / authority holder, when their DOA is highest among that file's contributors.
- term: Pre-departure authority diffusion
  definition: >-
    The degree to which DOA-based file ownership and authored-commit share had already shifted away from the founder to other
    contributors during the 6-12 months immediately before the founder's TFDD, measured as (a) the founder's share of authored/merged
    commits and (b) the count of distinct non-founder accounts that had already reached primary DOA ownership on at least
    one file in that window — a trajectory measurement Avelino et al.'s published methodology does not compute, since their
    TF/TFDD pipeline is evaluated only at and after the detachment point.
- term: Truck factor / bus factor
  definition: >-
    A classical software-engineering risk metric (Avelino et al. 2016 ICPC) estimating the minimal set of developers whose
    combined loss would put a project in serious trouble, computed via DOA at a single point in time; used here as a validated
    static baseline contrasted with the dynamic pre-departure trajectory this hypothesis targets.
- term: Post-departure survival
  definition: >-
    Following Avelino et al.'s Active/Inactive model: whether a project transitions back to Active (attracts a new TF developer)
    and shows non-trivial commit/release activity persisting at least 18 months after the founder's TFDD, rather than any
    formal abandonment announcement — consistent with Coelho & Valente's finding that most failed projects (542 of 618 in
    their sample) never post an explicit deprecation notice and must be identified from commit silence instead.
- term: Matched-pairs comparison
  definition: >-
    A study design that pairs founder-TFDD projects with similar confounding characteristics (stars, forks, total contributor
    count, language ecosystem, license type) but differing pre-departure authority-diffusion scores, isolating the diffusion
    trajectory's association with survival from the effect of raw project size or popularity — the latter of which Avelino
    et al. already show has negligible-to-small effect (d=0.13-0.26) at the TFDD snapshot itself.
summary: >-
  Whether an open-source project survives its founder stepping away is predicted not by its popularity or contributor count
  at the moment of departure — Avelino et al. (ESEM 2019) show these are statistically indistinguishable between survivors
  and non-survivors at the TFDD snapshot itself — but by whether commit/file authority had already diffused away from the
  founder to at least two other independent contributors in the 6-12 months BEFORE that departure. This reframes truck factor
  from Avelino et al.'s validated but purely at/after-the-fact snapshot metric into a leading, longitudinal 'authority diffusion
  trajectory' signal, directly testable by re-running their own published DOA/TF/TFDD pipeline one time-window earlier, and
  offers foundations an actionable, pre-departure-observable predictor rather than a post-hoc explanation.
_relation_rationale: >-
  Same frame; reframed as methodology contribution since outcome-conditioned corpus left causal test undefined.
_confidence_delta: decreased
_key_changes:

  Explicitly reframed as a methodology/calibration contribution rather than an empirical answer, per reviewer MAJOR#1 option

  a historical-snapshot sampling frame per reviewer MAJOR#3
- >-
  Downgraded the permutation-test result to construct-validity evidence only, explicitly decoupled from the causal diffusion-survival
  claim per reviewer MAJOR#2 and MINOR#7
- >-
  Added requirement to report the exact permutation scheme, achievable p-value resolution, and a larger-budget sensitivity
  check
- >-
  Added requirement to compute/cite Avelino et al.'s own CI for the 66% TF=1 statistic before claiming CI overlap
- >-
  Added requirement for a full repository table matching the dataset artifact exactly, and manual alias-resolution spot-checks
- >-
  Added requirement to situate the diffusion construct against OSS-native community-health/onboarding literature (CHAOSS,
  podling graduation), not only the cross-domain firm-succession analogy
- >-
  Confidence decreased: the causal claim this hypothesis centers on remains completely untested (0 outcome variance), and
  the sampling problem is now understood to be structural, not fixable by simply enlarging the same corpus

id: evaluation_iter2_dir3
type: evaluation
objective: >-
  Close every reviewer-named methodology-rigor and reporting gap on the existing 15-repo pipeline result: exact permutation-scheme
  disclosure with convergence at higher budget, Avelino et al.'s own confidence interval for the 66% TF=1 statistic, a manual
  alias-resolution spot-check against live GitHub contributor pages, a full exact repository table, and (if the new dataset
  artifact produced additional or non-survivor data) a re-run of the calibration gate and permutation test on the combined/expanded
  corpus with an explicit comparison of biased vs. non-conditioned sampling frames.
approach: >-
  Extend the prior evaluation's eval.py methodology: (1) report the exact permutation scheme used in that prior run — number
  of feasible distinct relocatable windows per repository given each project's history length, whether the 60/40 permutations
  were i.i.d. samples with or without replacement, the theoretical minimum achievable two-sided p-value given n and the permutation
  count, and re-run the permutation test at a substantially larger budget (e.g. 2000+ permutations per stratum, using the
  existing capped/cached DOA-recomputation fix) to report p-value convergence/stability versus the original 60/40-permutation
  result; (2) compute a Wilson 95% CI for Avelino et al.'s reported 66% TF=1 statistic from their stated n=315 TFDDs, and
  report it side-by-side with this paper's own CI rather than asserting 'overlapping' without the comparison interval; (3)
  manually spot-check the alias-resolution diagnostic's 0.0-median-collapse-rate finding against the actual GitHub contributor
  pages (via aii-web-tools fetch) for 2-3 corpus repositories, reporting whether any distinct-looking commit identities are
  actually the same contributor under a different email/handle, to test whether the diffusion score's 'distinct non-founder
  owner' counts are inflated by under-merging; (4) emit a full, exact table of all 15 (or more, if the dataset artifact's
  expansion completed) repositories with name, language, stars, commit-history years, and TFDD/survival status, matching the
  dataset artifact's actual output exactly, for inclusion as a paper table/appendix; (5) if the dataset artifact produced
  a non-conditioned or larger corpus, re-run Stage A calibration and the founder-only-TFDD extraction + permutation test on
  it and report explicitly whether TFDD incidence/survival rates move toward Avelino et al.'s reference values and whether
  outcome variance (a non-survivor) now exists, comparing this against the original 15-repo biased-frame results side by side
  as direct empirical evidence for the design-flaw-not-power-problem claim.

title: GitHub Founder-Departure Commit Corpus
summary: >-
  Built a real corpus of 15 well-known, well-documented open-source GitHub repositories (e.g. pallets/flask, BurntSushi/ripgrep,
  psf/black, Textualize/rich, httpie/cli, pyenv/pyenv, tiangolo/typer), each with full commit history obtained via `git clone`
  + `git log --numstat` (SHA, author name/email, ISO date, per-file insertions/deletions for every commit, newest-first, capped
  at 5,000 commits/repo with an explicit truncation flag) plus repo-level metadata from the GitHub REST API (stars, forks,
  primary language, license, created_at, pushed_at, open_issues, README excerpt). Each repo record also carries an empirically-computed
  `founder_signal`: the fraction of commits in the repo's first 365 days made by its single top-committing author email, and
  the top author's email. This directly operationalizes the plan's inclusion criterion (single-founder dominance >=70% of
  year-1 commits) without asserting it a priori -- it is measured from the real cloned git log. Repos span multiple languages
  (Python, Rust) and star bands (15k-72k stars in the current sample) and multi-year histories (6.6-16.4 years), giving enough
  post-founding history for an 18-month post-departure survival window. IMPORTANT SCOPE LIMITATION: this environment has no
  GITHUB_TOKEN, so the GitHub REST API is capped at 60 unauthenticated requests/hour (2 calls per repo: /repos/{full_name}
  and its /readme). This makes the plan's 150-250 repo target infeasible within the artifact time budget -- 15 repos were
  completed and checkpointed (12 in the final checkpoint snapshot, 15 repo-record files on disk) before the artifact needed
  to finalize; git clone itself (smart-HTTP) is NOT rate-limited, so every completed repo's commit history is complete and
  untruncated for its cap, only the TOTAL repo count is reduced. code/build_dataset.py and code/candidates.py contain a ~104-repo
  candidate list spanning Python/JS/Go/Ruby/Rust/C++/Java and a checkpointed, resumable pipeline (temp/checkpoint.json) that
  a downstream step can re-run with a GITHUB_TOKEN (raising the limit to 5,000 req/hour) to scale to the full 150-250 target
  without re-doing completed work. A HuggingFace candidate (kamalkishor1991/commit-messages-dataset, sampled commit diffs
  for commit-message generation) was evaluated and explicitly rejected as the primary source because it lacks per-repo lifecycle,
  author-identity-over-time, and per-file structure. data.py standardizes the corpus into the exp_sel_data_out.json schema:
  one dataset group `github_founder_departure_commits`, one example per repo, `input` = JSON-encoded {repo_metadata, founder_signal,
  truncated, commit_cap, commits[]}, `output` = derived label 'founder_dominant'/'not_founder_dominant' from the 0.7 year-1-share
  threshold, plus flat `metadata_*` fields (full_name, stars, language, history_years, n_commits, truncated, year1_top_author_share,
  task_type). Validated against the exp_sel_data_out schema (PASSED); full_data_out.json is 13.8MB (well under the 100MB limit),
  with mini_data_out.json and preview_data_out.json also produced.

title: Does authority spreading before founders leave keep projects alive?
summary: >-
  Reimplemented Avelino et al.'s (ESEM 2019) Degree-of-Authorship / Truck-Factor / Truck-Factor-Detachment-Departure (TFDD)
  pipeline end-to-end in method.py, run against the DATASET dependency's mined GitHub commit histories (15 usable repos with
  full per-file commit logs, out of 3427 raw records also containing an unrelated HuggingFace commit-message corpus that the
  loader correctly skips via a 'no_commits' filter). For each repo the pipeline: (1) resolves author aliases via normalized
  email/github-login matching and logs a per-repo alias-collapse-rate QA metric; (2) computes yearly cumulative-window DOA
  (Degree of Authorship) per file per author using Fritz et al.'s weights (FA=3.293, DL=1.098, AC=-1.017) as used by Avelino
  et al.; (3) derives the yearly greedy Truck-Factor set from primary DOA ownership; (4) detects Truck-Factor-Detachment-Departure
  events (a TF-set fully silent for 12 months) and isolates founder-only TFDDs (TF=1 and the sole departing developer is the
  repo's first human committer, with bulk-import first commits filtered per the Kalliamvakou et al. 2014 'perils of mining
  GitHub' heuristic of >80% of files touched within the first week); (5) computes a NEW pre-departure authority-diffusion
  trajectory over the 6-12 months before each TFDD -- founder commit-share and count of distinct non-founder DOA file-owners
  -- alongside Avelino et al.'s original at-TFDD snapshot covariates (developers/commits/files at detachment); (6) classifies
  18-month post-TFDD survival into Avelino's four-level active/inactive grades (thriving/maintained/dormant/dead) plus a binary
  survived flag; (7) runs a matched-pairs bootstrap comparison (nearest-neighbor matching on standardized log-stars/log-forks/log-contributors
  within language, comparing high- vs low-diffusion projects) with 10,000-resample 95% CIs; (8) fits BH-corrected logistic
  and ordinal (statsmodels OrderedModel) regressions of survival on diffusion predictors plus snapshot covariates, reporting
  standardized effect sizes comparable to Avelino et al.'s reported d=0.13 (files) / 0.25-0.26 (developers, commits); (9)
  runs a 500-iteration placebo/window-shuffle check that redraws the pre-departure window from elsewhere in project history
  and refits the regression, to test whether the true diffusion-window effect exceeds the null distribution of effects from
  arbitrary windows. All steps implement both the proposed authority-diffusion predictor AND Avelino et al.'s original snapshot-covariate
  baseline side-by-side in the same regression and matched-pairs machinery, so the two are directly comparable under identical
  data and identical statistical procedures -- baseline_predict and ourmethod_predict columns are both emitted per example.
  The run found n_repos_total=3427 raw dataset records (3409 filtered as non-repo commit-message rows lacking file-level structure;
  the dataset dependency's GitHub API rate limiting -- 60 unauthenticated requests/hour -- constrained the usable repo count
  to 15, well below the plan's 150-250 target), yielding n_founder_tfdd_events=6, which falls below the ~40 events the plan's
  own fallback_plan identifies as needed for a well-powered matched-pairs test; per that fallback plan this limitation is
  reported explicitly in the output metadata (extended_sample_used_TFle2 flag, doa_approximation_used flag, alias_qa block)
  rather than silently presented as adequately powered, and all regression/matched-pairs/placebo numbers in method_out.json
  should be read as a small-n pilot demonstrating the pipeline mechanics rather than a well-powered test of the founder-diffusion-predicts-survival
  hypothesis. A bug where the dataset dependency's example-wrapper format (repo records JSON-encoded inside an 'input' string
  field, per the exp_gen_sol_out schema) was not being unwrapped -- causing every repo to be misread as having zero commits
  -- was found and fixed during this run; the corrected loader now parses that wrapper and the pipeline runs end-to-end in
  ~90 seconds. Output method_out.json / full_method_out.json / mini_method_out.json / preview_method_out.json validate cleanly
  against the exp_gen_sol_out.json schema (0 errors) and are all under 9KB, far below the 100MB size limit. Downstream users
  (GEN_PAPER_TEXT) should present this as a methodology-validation / small-sample pilot result: the pipeline itself (DOA/TF/TFDD
  replication, diffusion-trajectory measurement, survival classification, matched-pairs + regression + placebo statistical
  machinery) is fully implemented and tested (smoke tests on synthetic hand-constructed repos, mini-run sanity checks, and
  the full corpus run all pass), but the headline finding is data-starved (n=6 events) due to upstream GitHub API rate limiting
  documented in the DATASET dependency's own metadata, not a pipeline defect.

<instructions>
YOUR ROLE: Write a detailed PLAN for the artifact. A separate executor agent runs the actual artifact later.

You are a PLANNER, not an executor. Your output is a plan that tells the executor what to do and how.
Do NOT execute the artifact itself — a separate agent handles that. Your job is to plan it so well that the executor can follow your plan step by step.

You CAN and SHOULD: search the web, read papers, and explore library docs to make your plan concrete.
You CANNOT run shell commands or scripts — code execution is disabled. Research via web tools only.

Do NOT do the executor's job: don't download datasets, don't implement code, don't run experiments, don't write proofs, don't compute evaluations.

<artifact_executor_scope>
IMPORTANT: Each artifact executor has a focused prompt that guides it to do ONE thing well. It will NOT perform tasks outside its scope — assigning the wrong work to the wrong artifact type wastes an iteration. Match the task to the right executor.

EVALUATION executor scope:
  Output: eval_out.json with evaluation results
  DOES: Any evaluation of experiment results — metrics, statistical tests, ablations, comparisons, visualizations, robustness checks, error analysis, etc.
  DOES NOT: Implement new methods (use EXPERIMENT), collect data (use DATASET)
  This is for analyzing experiment outputs from any angle
</artifact_executor_scope>

<artifact_planning_rules>
EVALUATION: Must depend on at least one EXPERIMENT. Focus on statistical rigor and validity checks.
</artifact_planning_rules>

<compute_profiles>
Choose the compute profile this artifact needs for execution.
Available profiles for evaluation artifacts:
  - gpu: 1x NVIDIA RTX A4500, 20GB VRAM, 7 vCPUs, 29GB RAM — ML training, CUDA, large models (fallback: GPUs cheap→expensive: 2000 Ada → A4000 → 4000 Ada → L4 → 4090 → 5090)
  - cpu_heavy: 4 vCPUs, 32GB RAM — large datasets, memory-intensive processing (fallback: CPUs cheap→expensive, then GPU hosts cheap→expensive (all ≥32GB RAM))

Set runpod_compute_profile to one of these exact tier names.
</compute_profiles>
GOOD PLANS: specific, actionable, consider failure scenarios, build on the suggested approach.
BAD PLANS: vague hand-waving, ignoring the suggested approach, missing critical executor details.
