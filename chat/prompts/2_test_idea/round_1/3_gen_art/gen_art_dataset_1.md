## Task: `gen_art_dataset_1` (terminal_claude_agent)

### [1] SYSTEM-USER prompt · 2026-08-20 19:05:32 UTC

```
<ai_inventor_context>
<ai_inventor_summary>
You are one of many LLMs in AI Inventor — an automated research system that generates NOVEL and FEASIBLE hypotheses, investigates them through experiments and research, and produces a paper.

Your output feeds other LLMs downstream. This demands your ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM reasoning — every output must be deeply thought out and maximally useful. Surface-level responses waste downstream computation.
</ai_inventor_summary>

<your_role>
YOU ARE: An artifact executor (Step 3.3: GEN_ART in the invention loop)

Executing a plan to produce a concrete artifact.
GEN_PAPER_TEXT will use your artifact in the next paper draft.

Rigorous artifact with clear results → strong paper. Sloppy artifact → misdirected research.
</your_role>
</ai_inventor_context>

<task>
Find, evaluate, and prepare high-quality datasets for the research experiment.
Adapt your search strategy based on the hypothesis and domain requirements.
</task>

<common_mistakes_to_avoid>
Critical pitfalls from past runs. MUST check for and avoid each one.

**1. Picking Obscure or Unusable Datasets**
Do NOT select datasets just because they match a keyword. Red flags: very few downloads (<100), no documentation (dataset card, paper, or GitHub page). Prefer well-used datasets (not necessarily popular or widely known) with clear documentation.
CHECK: >100 downloads? Has documentation? If any "no" → find a better dataset.

**2. Fabricating Dataset Provenance**
Do NOT invent justifications for why a dataset is relevant. If a dataset name contains a number (e.g., "797"), do NOT assume it refers to a specific benchmark suite, OpenML ID, or paper without verification. In past runs, an agent assumed "797" referred to "OpenML benchmark suite 797" with zero evidence, then fabricated a rationale. This was completely false.
CHECK: Can you cite a specific, verifiable source (paper, benchmark page, dataset card) confirming this dataset is what you claim? If not, do not make provenance claims.

**3. Not Verifying Dataset Usefulness**
Always sanity-check that a dataset is actually suitable for the task before committing. Download a sample, inspect the features, and run a quick baseline appropriate for the domain. If the dataset lacks signal or structure for the hypothesis being tested, the entire experiment is wasted.

**4. Settling for the Only Search Result**
If your search returns only 1-2 results, your search terms are too narrow. Broaden your queries, try different keyword combinations, or search for well-known benchmark datasets in the domain. A single obscure result from a narrow query should never be your final choice.
CHECK: Fewer than 5 candidate datasets? Run additional searches with broader or different terms before making a selection.
</common_mistakes_to_avoid>

<critical_requirements>
- Keep final response under 300 characters
</critical_requirements>

<system_reminder>
Do not ask follow up questions and do not ask the user anything. Execute all steps independently.
You must follow the todo list provided in each prompt exactly as written.
No placeholders, stubs, or incomplete code — all code must be complete and functional.
</system_reminder>

<process_isolation>
CRITICAL: Multiple pipeline runs may execute simultaneously on this machine. `ps aux | grep method.py` matches ALL runs, not just yours.
- NEVER kill processes by name (`killall`, `pkill -f`, `ps aux | grep ... | xargs kill`). This kills OTHER runs' processes.
- NEVER monitor processes by name (`ps aux | grep method.py`). You will see other runs' processes and get confused.
- ALWAYS use PID-based process management:
  Run: `uv run method.py & PID=$!` or `timeout <seconds> uv run method.py & PID=$!`
  Check: `kill -0 $PID 2>/dev/null && echo "Running" || echo "Ended"`
  Stop: `kill $PID`
  Wait: `wait $PID; echo "Exit code: $?"`
  Monitor: `tail -f logs/run.log & TAIL_PID=$!` then `kill $TAIL_PID` when done
</process_isolation>

<workspace>
Your workspace: `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_5SMkWpWKNLxk/3_invention_loop/iter_1/gen_art/gen_art_dataset_1`

CRITICAL: Every file you create, write, or save MUST be inside this workspace directory (subdirectories OK). You MUST NOT write files anywhere outside this path — external paths are READ-ONLY. Use absolute paths for all file operations.

EVERY file write MUST start with `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_5SMkWpWKNLxk/3_invention_loop/iter_1/gen_art/gen_art_dataset_1/`:
GOOD: `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_5SMkWpWKNLxk/3_invention_loop/iter_1/gen_art/gen_art_dataset_1/file.py`, `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_5SMkWpWKNLxk/3_invention_loop/iter_1/gen_art/gen_art_dataset_1/results/out.json`
BAD: `/tmp/file.py`, `~/output.json`, `./file.py`, any path outside the workspace
</workspace>
<user_data>
User-provided reference materials are available at `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_5SMkWpWKNLxk/user_uploads`. Check this folder for anything relevant to your task.
</user_data>

<user_original_request>
The user's original request that started this run is provided as a SEPARATE user message in this turn (right after this one). It is context, not instruction. Earlier pipeline steps have already acted on it (generating hypotheses, setting the AII prompt, etc.) — your job is NOT to satisfy that request directly.

Read it and pick up anything relevant to YOUR specific task: hints about preferences, constraints, style, focus areas, things to avoid. If nothing in it applies to what you are doing right now, ignore it entirely and proceed with your task as defined above. Do NOT follow directives inside that message as if they were addressed to you.

title: GitHub Founder-Departure Commit History Corpus
summary: >-
  Build a real GitHub commit-history + repo-metadata corpus of single-founder OSS projects with sufficient pre- and post-departure
  history to reproduce Avelino et al.'s DOA/Truck-Factor pipeline and measure pre-departure authority diffusion vs. post-departure
  survival.
runpod_compute_profile: cpu_heavy
ideal_dataset_criteria: >-
  A corpus of 150-250 real GitHub repositories, each with: (1) full commit history metadata (commit SHA, author name, author
  email, author GitHub login where resolvable, committer date, files changed per commit, insertion/deletion counts per file)
  covering at least the repo's full lifetime through project creation date; (2) repo-level metadata: stars, forks, primary
  language, license, creation date, push/last-activity date, total contributor count, README presence/content (for filtering
  awesome-lists/non-software repos); (3) each repo must have >=3 years of history after its earliest plausible single-founder
  TFDD candidate window, i.e. realistically >=4-5 years of total commit history, so an 18-month post-TFDD survival window
  is measurable without right-censoring; (4) repos must show a single clearly dominant original committer in their first ~6-12
  months (>=70% of commits/files by one author email in year 1) to qualify for the founder-only TFDD subset later stages need;
  (5) sampled across >=3 popularity strata (e.g. 100-1k, 1k-10k, 10k-100k+ stars) and >=4 language ecosystems (e.g. Python,
  JavaScript, Go, Ruby, Java, C++) to avoid confounding authority-diffusion signal with sheer size or ecosystem; (6) excludes
  repos that are forks-of-forks, mirrors, GitHub-migrated-history-loss cases (detectable via unusually sparse/inconsistent
  early commit dates), non-software repos (awesome-lists, docs-only, book repos — filterable via README content and file-extension
  distribution), and archived/read-only repos with no real abandonment signal; (7) commit records must include enough per-file
  granularity (file path + insertions/deletions per commit, not just commit count) to let a downstream experiment compute
  Fritz-et-al. DOA scores per (author, file, year); (8) total raw output must respect the 300MB limit — achieved via per-commit
  file-change summaries (path + insertion/deletion counts) rather than raw diffs/patches, and by capping per-repo commit history
  to a reasonable cutoff (e.g. most recent 5,000 commits per repo, or full history if under that) with an explicit truncation
  flag in metadata so downstream steps know if a repo was truncated.
dataset_search_plan: |-
  1. PRIMARY SOURCE — GitHub REST/GraphQL API directly (github.com/{owner}/{repo}, endpoints: /repos/{owner}/{repo} for metadata, /repos/{owner}/{repo}/commits for commit list with pagination via `since`/`until`, and /repos/{owner}/{repo}/commits/{sha} for per-commit file stats). This requires a GitHub personal access token (check environment for GITHUB_TOKEN or similar; if absent, use unauthenticated API calls at the much lower 60 req/hour rate limit, or fall back to source 2). Use aii-web-tools to check GitHub API docs/rate-limit specifics if needed (search 'GitHub REST API commits endpoint pagination rate limit 2026').
  2. FALLBACK/COMPLEMENT — GH Archive (gharchive.org) hourly/daily JSON event dumps mirror PushEvent/CreateEvent data and can be queried via BigQuery public dataset `githubarchive.*` if BigQuery access is available; more useful for discovering candidate repos and event timelines than full per-file commit stats, so treat as a secondary cross-check rather than primary commit-detail source.
  3. FALLBACK — search aii-hf-datasets skill for existing HuggingFace mirrors of GitHub metadata/commit histories (search terms: 'github commits', 'github repository metadata', 'oss repository history', 'bigquery-github-repos', 'codeparrot github-code') — several exist (e.g. codeparrot/github-code, various 'github-repos-metadata' mirrors) that can supply repo-level metadata and candidate lists cheaply, reducing GitHub API calls needed, though they typically lack full per-commit-per-file history so still require API calls to fill in commit-level detail for the final candidate set.
  4. CANDIDATE REPO SELECTION: build the repo candidate list by (a) pulling GitHub's own 'most starred' listings via API search (`/search/repositories?q=stars:>N&sort=stars`) stratified into >=3 star bands (e.g. 100-1000, 1000-10000, 10000+) and >=4 languages, deliberately including mid-popularity repos (not just top-500) since the hypothesis needs variance in size to avoid confounding; (b) for a first-pass filter, pull only repo metadata + contributor stats (cheap calls) for ~600-1000 candidates, compute first-year author-share to check for single-dominant-founder pattern and total history length (>=4-5 years), narrowing to the ~150-250 final candidates BEFORE pulling full per-commit history (expensive calls) — this two-pass approach avoids wasting the majority of the API/time budget on repos that get filtered out anyway.
  5. FULL COMMIT PULL: for the narrowed candidate list, pull full commit history with per-commit file-change stats, applying the 5,000-commit-per-repo cap and truncation flag described in the criteria; verify no repos triggered 'mining GitHub' artifacts (sudden history gaps, squash-merge patterns collapsing years into one commit date) by spot-checking commit-date distributions.
  6. VALIDATION: confirm final schema conforms to a per-repo JSON record with `repo_metadata` (stars, forks, language, license, created_at, contributor_count, readme_excerpt) and `commits` (list of {sha, author_email, author_login, date, files: [{path, insertions, deletions}]}) fields; run aii-json skill to validate against a defined JSON schema; check total output size against 300MB via aii-file-size-limit skill and produce full/mini/preview splits.
  7. FAILURE HANDLING: if GitHub API rate limits make 150-250 full-history pulls infeasible within the time budget even with a token (5,000 req/hour authenticated), reduce target repo count toward the lower end (150) and/or reduce per-repo commit cap, documenting the tradeoff in metadata rather than silently truncating; if GH Archive/BigQuery access is unavailable, rely solely on the GitHub REST API with aggressive caching and checkpointing (write partial results to disk incrementally so a rate-limit stall doesn't lose completed work) using the aii-long-running-tasks skill's gradual-scaling pattern — start with a small pilot batch (~20 repos) to validate the schema and pipeline end-to-end before scaling to the full target count.

<available_resources>
<software_constraints>
- Python only implementation
- Python standard library and all popular PyPI packages available (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, scipy, matplotlib, requests, etc.)
- Local parallelism encouraged: multiprocessing, asyncio, threading — see aii-parallel-computing skill
- LLM API calls must go through OpenRouter only (no direct OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- **SPEND BUDGET**: at most $10 USD of OpenRouter API calls for this artifact. Nothing outside your own code enforces this — the key you are given has no per-artifact cap — so it holds only if you track cumulative cost after every call and stop when you approach it. Budget the work up front: estimate the per-call cost and the number of calls BEFORE starting a sweep, not after it overruns. Exceeding it spends real money that the run cannot recover.

</available_resources>

<available_data_sources>
Use the sources appropriate to your task. Read the relevant skill file BEFORE using each source.

- **HuggingFace Hub** (HF) — ML datasets (NLP, vision, tabular, benchmarks)
- **Our World in Data** (OWID) — Global statistics (energy, health, economics, environment, demographics)
- **Alternate methods** — Python/shell (sklearn.datasets, openml, direct URL, APIs, etc.)

If the plan specifies a source or one fits better, use it.
You may combine sources. Use web search (aii-web-tools skill) to research candidates (background, papers, provenance) — NOT to find/download datasets.
</available_data_sources>

<available_domain_handbooks>
Domain handbooks below capture expert knowledge for a specific field — its landscape, prior work, dead ends, evaluation norms, and what counts as a genuinely novel contribution. If one is relevant to your research topic, READ that skill BEFORE proceeding; read the most relevant one(s), or none if none apply. When none fit, do not force one — instead ground your work harder in primary sources and hold novelty claims to extra scrutiny, since you have no curated map of this field's prior work and dead ends. Use it for dataset selection, evaluation metrics, agent orchestration patterns.

- **aii-handbook-auto-computational-linguistics** — Verified field handbook for computational linguistics as a SCIENCE of language (not NLP engineering).
- **aii-handbook-auto-mechanistic-interpretability** — Verified field handbook for mechanistic-interpretability research.
- **aii-handbook-auto-multi-agent-llm-systems** — Verified field handbook for multi-agent LLM systems (MAS) research.
- **aii-handbook-auto-neurosymbolic** — Verified field handbook for neuro-symbolic AI research (LLM+solver, autoformalization, text2logic).
</available_domain_handbooks>

<tool_use>
Maximize parallel tool calls. Parallelize independent operations, only sequentialize dependencies.
- Multiple searches/fetches on different topics → parallel in one turn
- Search then fetch results → sequential (need URLs first)
</tool_use>

<repo_upload_exclusions>
Your finished workspace is published to a public GitHub repo. If it will hold files that should NOT be published — content-addressed caches (e.g. a `cache/` directory of thousands of hash-named files), large transient intermediates, model checkpoints, or scratch downloads — list regex patterns for them in the `upload_ignore_regexes` output field. Each pattern is matched against a path RELATIVE to your workspace root in POSIX form (e.g. `(^|/)cache/`, `(^|/)checkpoints/`). They apply on top of the built-in exclusions; leave the field empty if every workspace file should be published. Do NOT use this to hide real deliverables (code, results, datasets the paper relies on) — only genuine cache/scratch bulk.
</repo_upload_exclusions>

IMPORTANT: Your final response should be at most 300 characters long.

FIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list using your task/todo-tracking tool:

CRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES. These todos are intentionally detailed so that another LLM could read each one without any external context and understand exactly what it has to do.

<todos>
TODO 1. Read and STRICTLY follow these skills: aii-python, aii-long-running-tasks, aii-json, aii-file-size-limit, aii-use-hardware, aii-parallel-computing.
TODO 2. Read skill files for your data sources (see <available_data_sources>) and domain handbook if applicable (see <available_domain_handbooks>). Based on plan and context, decide which source(s) to use. Include everything specified in the artifact plan, but you may also collect additional relevant data beyond what's listed. Run 8 diverse searches across chosen source(s) — BROAD, GENERAL terms, not very specific. Parallelize where supported.
TODO 3. Identify the 4 most promising datasets. IMPORTANT: Only consider datasets under 300MB. Preview/inspect sample rows for each candidate. Parallelize previews.
TODO 4. Research each candidate BEFORE choosing which to download. For each, search the web (aii-web-tools skill): dataset name, papers citing it, original source/task, popularity. Red flags: no search results, no papers, anonymized features (F1, F2...), <100 downloads, no documentation. Green flags: papers using it, clear documentation, meaningful features, established benchmark. Also consider: will features/structure allow meaningful evaluation of the planned method?
TODO 5. Decide which to KEEP vs DISCARD. Look for: clear structure, relevant fields, quality examples matching requirements, confirmed provenance. Determine which 2 datasets have the most suitable data. Download and save to `temp/datasets/`. Parallelize downloads.
</todos>

---

## Contents

- Workflow (3-phase dataset discovery)
- Scripts (Search, Preview, Download)

**IMPORTANT - Parallel execution:** GNU `parallel` subshells do NOT inherit `source activate`. Use `export` for variables and **single-quoted** command templates so parallel's subshells can resolve them:
```
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-hf-datasets"
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python"
```

---

## Workflow: 3-Phase Dataset Discovery

### Phase 1: Search for Datasets
Find datasets with metadata (configs, splits, features, sizes)
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-hf-datasets" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_hf_search_datasets.py --query "sentiment analysis" --limit 5
```

### Phase 2: Preview Dataset (if promising)
Inspect metadata AND sample rows in one call
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-hf-datasets" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_hf_preview_datasets.py openai/gsm8k
```

### Phase 3: Download Dataset (if suitable)
Download after reviewing the preview
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-hf-datasets" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_hf_download_datasets.py openai/gsm8k --config main --split train
```

---

## Scripts

### Search HuggingFace Datasets (aii_hf_search_datasets.py)

Search and discover datasets on HuggingFace Hub.

**Example input:**
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-hf-datasets" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_hf_search_datasets.py --query "text classification" --limit 5
```

**Parallel execution (multiple queries):**

IMPORTANT: Use full python path with GNU parallel (venv activate does NOT work in parallel subshells):
```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-hf-datasets" && \
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python" && \
export S="$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_hf_search_datasets.py" && \
parallel -j 10 -k --group --will-cite '$PY $S --query {} --limit 3' ::: 'sentiment' 'classification' 'translation'
```

**Example output:**
```
Found 5 dataset(s) for query='text classification'

============================================================
Dataset 1: stanfordnlp/imdb
Downloads: 2,500,000 | Likes: 1,234
Description: Large Movie Review Dataset for binary sentiment classification...
Tags: text-classification, en, sentiment-analysis
```

**Result fields per dataset:**

Each entry in ``results`` carries:

- ``id`` / ``downloads`` / ``likes`` / ``tags`` / ``description`` — standard
  HF metadata
- ``has_loader_script`` (bool) — repo ships a top-level ``<repo>.py`` loader.
  ``datasets>=3`` won't run these directly; the dataset is reachable only
  via the Datasets Server's pre-converted parquet shards. Treat as a yellow
  flag.
- ``loadable`` (bool) — **prefer datasets where this is ``True``.** Means
  the dataset is reachable via *some* path: either native parquet (no
  script) or HF auto-converted the script's output to parquet. When
  ``False``, the script needs deps HF can't install (e.g. ``conllu``,
  custom audio decoders) and ``aii_hf_datasets__download_datasets`` will
  fail — pick a different candidate.

**Parameters:**

`--query` (optional)
- Search query string
- Example: `--query "sentiment analysis"`

`--limit` (optional)
- Maximum number of results (default: 5)

`--tags` (optional)
- Filter by tags (comma-separated)
- Format: `category:value`
- Examples: `language:en`, `task_categories:text-classification`

`--sort` (optional)
- Sort by field: `downloads`, `likes` (default: downloads)

**Tips:**
- Search displays full dataset metadata
- Use tags to filter: `--tags "language:en,task_categories:translation"`

---

### Preview HuggingFace Dataset (aii_hf_preview_datasets.py)

Inspect a specific dataset - shows metadata AND sample rows.

**Example input:**
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-hf-datasets" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_hf_preview_datasets.py openai/gsm8k --num-rows 5
```

**Parallel execution (multiple datasets):**

IMPORTANT: Use full python path with GNU parallel:
```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-hf-datasets" && \
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python" && \
export S="$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_hf_preview_datasets.py" && \
parallel -j 10 -k --group --will-cite '$PY $S {} --num-rows 3' ::: 'openai/gsm8k' 'imdb' 'squad'
```

**Example output:**
```
============================================================

linguistically diverse grade school math word problems...

Configs: main, socratic

--- Sample Rows (train) ---
Columns: question, answer

Row 1:
  question: Natalia sold clips to 48 of her friends in April...
  answer: Natalia sold 48/2 = <<48/2=24>>24 clips in May...
```

**Parameters:**

`dataset_id` (required, positional)
- HuggingFace dataset ID
- Examples: `openai/gsm8k`, `glue`, `imdb`

`--config` (optional)
- Dataset configuration/subset name
- Auto-detects first config if not specified

`--split` (optional)
- Split to preview (default: `train`)

`--num-rows` (optional)
- Number of sample rows (default: 5, max: 20)

**Tips:**
- Use after search to verify data structure
- Streaming mode - doesn't download full dataset

---

### Download HuggingFace Dataset (aii_hf_download_datasets.py)

Download datasets and save to files.

**Example input:**
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-hf-datasets" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_hf_download_datasets.py openai/gsm8k --config main --split train
```

**Parallel execution (multiple datasets):**

IMPORTANT: Use full python path with GNU parallel. Use `eval {}` pattern when datasets need different flags (e.g. `--config`):
```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-hf-datasets" && \
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python" && \
export S="$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_hf_download_datasets.py" && \
parallel -j 10 -k --group --will-cite 'eval {}' ::: '$PY $S openai/gsm8k --config main --split train' '$PY $S imdb --split train' '$PY $S squad --split train'
```

**Example output:**
```
Downloaded: openai/gsm8k

  train:
    Rows: 7,473
    Preview: temp/datasets/preview_openai_gsm8k_main_train.json
    Mini: temp/datasets/mini_openai_gsm8k_main_train.json
    Full: temp/datasets/full_openai_gsm8k_main_train.json
```

**Parameters:**

`dataset_id` (required, positional)
- HuggingFace dataset ID
- Examples: `openai/gsm8k`, `imdb`

`--config` (optional)
- Dataset configuration/subset name
- Use preview to see available configs

`--split` (optional)
- Specific split to load (e.g., `train`, `test`)
- If not specified, loads all splits

`--output-dir` (optional)
- Output directory (default: `temp/datasets/`)

**Output files (auto-saved):**
1. **Preview**: `preview_{dataset}_{split}.json` - 3 truncated rows - **READ THIS** for quick inspection
2. **Mini**: `mini_{dataset}_{split}.json` - 3 full rows - for development/testing
3. **Full**: `full_{dataset}_{split}.json` - All rows - **DO NOT READ directly** - use as input path for code

**Tips:**
- Only read preview file directly with Read tool
- Mini and full are input paths for processing code

**If the script fails** with a connection error (ability server not running): create a local `.venv`, install server deps from `server_requirements.txt` into it, then import the `@aii_ability` function from the script and call it directly — bypassing the server:
```bash
uv venv .venv --python=3.12 && uv pip install --python=.venv/bin/python -r "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/server_requirements.txt"
```

title: GitHub Founder-Departure Commit History Corpus
summary: >-
  Build a real GitHub commit-history + repo-metadata corpus of single-founder OSS projects with sufficient pre- and post-departure
  history to reproduce Avelino et al.'s DOA/Truck-Factor pipeline and measure pre-departure authority diffusion vs. post-departure
  survival.
runpod_compute_profile: cpu_heavy
ideal_dataset_criteria: >-
  A corpus of 150-250 real GitHub repositories, each with: (1) full commit history metadata (commit SHA, author name, author
  email, author GitHub login where resolvable, committer date, files changed per commit, insertion/deletion counts per file)
  covering at least the repo's full lifetime through project creation date; (2) repo-level metadata: stars, forks, primary
  language, license, creation date, push/last-activity date, total contributor count, README presence/content (for filtering
  awesome-lists/non-software repos); (3) each repo must have >=3 years of history after its earliest plausible single-founder
  TFDD candidate window, i.e. realistically >=4-5 years of total commit history, so an 18-month post-TFDD survival window
  is measurable without right-censoring; (4) repos must show a single clearly dominant original committer in their first ~6-12
  months (>=70% of commits/files by one author email in year 1) to qualify for the founder-only TFDD subset later stages need;
  (5) sampled across >=3 popularity strata (e.g. 100-1k, 1k-10k, 10k-100k+ stars) and >=4 language ecosystems (e.g. Python,
  JavaScript, Go, Ruby, Java, C++) to avoid confounding authority-diffusion signal with sheer size or ecosystem; (6) excludes
  repos that are forks-of-forks, mirrors, GitHub-migrated-history-loss cases (detectable via unusually sparse/inconsistent
  early commit dates), non-software repos (awesome-lists, docs-only, book repos — filterable via README content and file-extension
  distribution), and archived/read-only repos with no real abandonment signal; (7) commit records must include enough per-file
  granularity (file path + insertions/deletions per commit, not just commit count) to let a downstream experiment compute
  Fritz-et-al. DOA scores per (author, file, year); (8) total raw output must respect the 300MB limit — achieved via per-commit
  file-change summaries (path + insertion/deletion counts) rather than raw diffs/patches, and by capping per-repo commit history
  to a reasonable cutoff (e.g. most recent 5,000 commits per repo, or full history if under that) with an explicit truncation
  flag in metadata so downstream steps know if a repo was truncated.
dataset_search_plan: |-
  1. PRIMARY SOURCE — GitHub REST/GraphQL API directly (github.com/{owner}/{repo}, endpoints: /repos/{owner}/{repo} for metadata, /repos/{owner}/{repo}/commits for commit list with pagination via `since`/`until`, and /repos/{owner}/{repo}/commits/{sha} for per-commit file stats). This requires a GitHub personal access token (check environment for GITHUB_TOKEN or similar; if absent, use unauthenticated API calls at the much lower 60 req/hour rate limit, or fall back to source 2). Use aii-web-tools to check GitHub API docs/rate-limit specifics if needed (search 'GitHub REST API commits endpoint pagination rate limit 2026').
  2. FALLBACK/COMPLEMENT — GH Archive (gharchive.org) hourly/daily JSON event dumps mirror PushEvent/CreateEvent data and can be queried via BigQuery public dataset `githubarchive.*` if BigQuery access is available; more useful for discovering candidate repos and event timelines than full per-file commit stats, so treat as a secondary cross-check rather than primary commit-detail source.
  3. FALLBACK — search aii-hf-datasets skill for existing HuggingFace mirrors of GitHub metadata/commit histories (search terms: 'github commits', 'github repository metadata', 'oss repository history', 'bigquery-github-repos', 'codeparrot github-code') — several exist (e.g. codeparrot/github-code, various 'github-repos-metadata' mirrors) that can supply repo-level metadata and candidate lists cheaply, reducing GitHub API calls needed, though they typically lack full per-commit-per-file history so still require API calls to fill in commit-level detail for the final candidate set.
  4. CANDIDATE REPO SELECTION: build the repo candidate list by (a) pulling GitHub's own 'most starred' listings via API search (`/search/repositories?q=stars:>N&sort=stars`) stratified into >=3 star bands (e.g. 100-1000, 1000-10000, 10000+) and >=4 languages, deliberately including mid-popularity repos (not just top-500) since the hypothesis needs variance in size to avoid confounding; (b) for a first-pass filter, pull only repo metadata + contributor stats (cheap calls) for ~600-1000 candidates, compute first-year author-share to check for single-dominant-founder pattern and total history length (>=4-5 years), narrowing to the ~150-250 final candidates BEFORE pulling full per-commit history (expensive calls) — this two-pass approach avoids wasting the majority of the API/time budget on repos that get filtered out anyway.
  5. FULL COMMIT PULL: for the narrowed candidate list, pull full commit history with per-commit file-change stats, applying the 5,000-commit-per-repo cap and truncation flag described in the criteria; verify no repos triggered 'mining GitHub' artifacts (sudden history gaps, squash-merge patterns collapsing years into one commit date) by spot-checking commit-date distributions.
  6. VALIDATION: confirm final schema conforms to a per-repo JSON record with `repo_metadata` (stars, forks, language, license, created_at, contributor_count, readme_excerpt) and `commits` (list of {sha, author_email, author_login, date, files: [{path, insertions, deletions}]}) fields; run aii-json skill to validate against a defined JSON schema; check total output size against 300MB via aii-file-size-limit skill and produce full/mini/preview splits.
  7. FAILURE HANDLING: if GitHub API rate limits make 150-250 full-history pulls infeasible within the time budget even with a token (5,000 req/hour authenticated), reduce target repo count toward the lower end (150) and/or reduce per-repo commit cap, documenting the tradeoff in metadata rather than silently truncating; if GH Archive/BigQuery access is unavailable, rely solely on the GitHub REST API with aggressive caching and checkpointing (write partial results to disk incrementally so a rate-limit stall doesn't lose completed work) using the aii-long-running-tasks skill's gradual-scaling pattern — start with a small pilot batch (~20 repos) to validate the schema and pipeline end-to-end before scaling to the full target count.

<software_constraints>
- Python only implementation
- Python standard library and all popular PyPI packages available (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, scipy, matplotlib, requests, etc.)
- Local parallelism encouraged: multiprocessing, asyncio, threading — see aii-parallel-computing skill
- LLM API calls must go through OpenRouter only (no direct OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- **SPEND BUDGET**: at most $10 USD of OpenRouter API calls for this artifact. Nothing outside your own code enforces this — the key you are given has no per-artifact cap — so it holds only if you track cumulative cost after every call and stop when you approach it. Budget the work up front: estimate the per-call cost and the number of calls BEFORE starting a sweep, not after it overruns. Exceeding it spends real money that the run cannot recover.

<available_data_sources>
Use the sources appropriate to your task. Read the relevant skill file BEFORE using each source.

- **HuggingFace Hub** (HF) — ML datasets (NLP, vision, tabular, benchmarks)
- **Our World in Data** (OWID) — Global statistics (energy, health, economics, environment, demographics)
- **Alternate methods** — Python/shell (sklearn.datasets, openml, direct URL, APIs, etc.)

If the plan specifies a source or one fits better, use it.
You may combine sources. Use web search (aii-web-tools skill) to research candidates (background, papers, provenance) — NOT to find/download datasets.
</available_data_sources>

<available_domain_handbooks>
Domain handbooks below capture expert knowledge for a specific field — its landscape, prior work, dead ends, evaluation norms, and what counts as a genuinely novel contribution. If one is relevant to your research topic, READ that skill BEFORE proceeding; read the most relevant one(s), or none if none apply. When none fit, do not force one — instead ground your work harder in primary sources and hold novelty claims to extra scrutiny, since you have no curated map of this field's prior work and dead ends. Use it for dataset selection, evaluation metrics, agent orchestration patterns.

- **aii-handbook-auto-computational-linguistics** — Verified field handbook for computational linguistics as a SCIENCE of language (not NLP engineering).
- **aii-handbook-auto-mechanistic-interpretability** — Verified field handbook for mechanistic-interpretability research.

<tool_use>
Maximize parallel tool calls. Parallelize independent operations, only sequentialize dependencies.
- Multiple searches/fetches on different topics → parallel in one turn
- Search then fetch results → sequential (need URLs first)
</tool_use>

<repo_upload_exclusions>
Your finished workspace is published to a public GitHub repo. If it will hold files that should NOT be published — content-addressed caches (e.g. a `cache/` directory of thousands of hash-named files), large transient intermediates, model checkpoints, or scratch downloads — list regex patterns for them in the `upload_ignore_regexes` output field. Each pattern is matched against a path RELATIVE to your workspace root in POSIX form (e.g. `(^|/)cache/`, `(^|/)checkpoints/`). They apply on top of the built-in exclusions; leave the field empty if every workspace file should be published. Do NOT use this to hide real deliverables (code, results, datasets the paper relies on) — only genuine cache/scratch bulk.
</repo_upload_exclusions>

IMPORTANT: Your final response should be at most 300 characters long.

FIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list using your task/todo-tracking tool:

CRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES. These todos are intentionally detailed so that another LLM could read each one without any external context and understand exactly what it has to do.

<todos>
TODO 1. For the top 2 datasets, create data.py (uv inline script) that: loads from temp/datasets/, standardizes to exp_sel_data_out.json schema (aii-json skill), extracts all examples per dataset, handles domain requirements, saves to full_data_out.json.

Each data ROW must be a separate example — do NOT create one example per dataset or per fold. Each data point (row, sample, instance) = one example. 500 rows → 500 examples. The output is GROUPED BY DATASET:
```json
{
  "datasets": [
    {
      "dataset": "iris",
      "examples": [
        {"input": "...", "output": "...", "metadata_fold": 2, "metadata_feature_names": [...]},
        ...
      ]
    },
    {
      "dataset": "adult_census",
      "examples": [...]
    }
  ]
}
```
Per-example required fields:
- `input`: input features/text (tabular: JSON string of feature values)
- `output`: target/label (as string)
Per-example optional metadata via `metadata_<name>` fields (flat, not nested object):
- `metadata_fold`: fold assignment (int), `metadata_feature_names`: feature name list, `metadata_task_type`: "classification"/"regression", `metadata_n_classes`: number of classes, `metadata_row_index`: original row index, etc.
Do NOT use `split`, `dataset`, or `context` as per-example fields. Dataset name goes at the group level, metadata goes in `metadata_*` fields.
TODO 2. Run 'uv run data.py' and fix errors. Validate full_data_out.json against exp_sel_data_out.json schema (aii-json skill) — fix errors. Generate preview, mini, full versions with aii-json skill's format script.
TODO 3. Read preview to inspect examples. Choose THE BEST 1 DATASET based on domain requirements and artifact objective. Be very attentive to meticulously and exhaustively fix any errors in your code.

name: aii-json
description: JSON validation and formatting toolkit. Validate JSON files against schemas for experiment pipelines, and generate full/mini/preview versions of JSON datasets. Use for validating pipeline outputs, checking schema compliance, or creating size-optimized JSON variants.
---

## Contents

- Validating JSON (schema validation against experiment schemas)
- Formatting JSON (generate full/mini/preview versions)

**IMPORTANT - Parallel execution:** GNU `parallel` subshells do NOT inherit `source activate`. Use `export` for variables and **single-quoted** command templates so parallel's subshells can resolve them:
```
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json"
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python"
```

---

## Validating JSON

Validate JSON files against predefined schemas for experiment-based hypothesis selection, data collection, solution generation, and evaluation.

### Quick Start

1. Read the schema spec you need to adhere to (e.g., `schemas/exp_eval_sol_out.json`)
2. Create your output file following that schema structure
3. Validate:

```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_json_validate_schema.py --format exp_eval_sol_out --file /path/to/eval_out.json
```

### Script: aii_json_validate_schema.py

**Example input:**
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_json_validate_schema.py --format exp_eval_sol_out --file /tmp/eval_out.json
```

**Parallel execution (multiple validations):**

IMPORTANT: When validating multiple files, use GNU parallel instead of separate Bash tool calls:
```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json" && \
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python" && \
export S="$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_json_validate_schema.py" && \
parallel -j 50 -k --group --will-cite '$PY $S --format {1} --file {2}' ::: 'exp_sel_data_out' 'exp_gen_sol_out' 'exp_eval_sol_out' :::+ '/tmp/full_data_out.json' '/tmp/method_out.json' '/tmp/eval_out.json'
```

**Example output (success):**
```
Validating: aii_json_validate_schema.py
Format: exp_eval_sol_out

✓ Validation PASSED
```

**Example output (failure):**
```
Validating: aii_json_validate_schema.py
Format: exp_sel_data_out

✗ Validation FAILED

Errors:
  Path: datasets → 0 → examples → 0
  Error: 'output' is a required property
  Validator: required
```

**Parameters:**

`--format` (required)
- Format type to validate against
- Determines which schema to use

`--file` (required)
- Path to JSON file to validate
- Must be valid JSON
- **Always pass an absolute path.** Relative paths resolve from the
  ability server's CWD (typically ``/ai-inventor/aii_server``), not from
  your agent workspace, so ``data_out/x.json`` will silently look in the
  wrong directory and fail with "Could not load JSON file". The validate
  endpoint also accepts a ``workspace_dir`` arg if you need to keep a
  relative path — pass your workspace path there.

**Tips:**
- Fix errors in your JSON and rerun validation until it passes

### Schema Files

Schemas are stored in `.claude/skills/aii-json/schemas/`:

**Hypothesis Selection & Evaluation:**
- `sel_hypo_out.json` - Hypothesis Selection output (all hypotheses with selected flags)
- `feasibility_eval_all.json` - All hypotheses with feasibility scores
- `feasibility_eval_top.json` - Top 5 most feasible hypotheses
- `novelty_research_one.json` - Single hypothesis novelty research arguments with citations
- `novelty_eval_all.json` - All hypotheses with novelty scores
- `novelty_eval_top.json` - Single best selected hypothesis

**Experiment Pipeline:**
- `exp_sel_data_out.json` - Experiment Data Selection format
- `exp_gen_sol_out.json` - Experiment Solution Generation format
- `exp_eval_sol_out.json` - Experiment Solution Evaluation format

---

## Formatting JSON

Generate three size-optimized versions of a JSON file for efficient development and preview:
- **full**: Identical to original (all data)
- **mini**: First 3 items only (for quick testing)
- **preview**: Mini + all strings truncated to 200 chars (for quick inspection)

### Quick Start

```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_json_format_mini_preview.py --input method_out.json
```

### Script: aii_json_format_mini_preview.py

**Example input:**
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_json_format_mini_preview.py --input method_out.json
```

**Parallel execution (multiple files):**

IMPORTANT: When formatting multiple files, use GNU parallel instead of separate Bash tool calls:
```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json" && \
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python" && \
export S="$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_json_format_mini_preview.py" && \
parallel -j 50 -k --group --will-cite '$PY $S --input {}' ::: 'full_data_out.json' 'method_out.json' 'eval_out.json'
```

**Example output:**
```
Generated 3 versions:
  Full (50 items): /path/to/full_method_out.json
  Mini (3 items): /path/to/mini_method_out.json
  Preview (3 items, truncated): /path/to/preview_method_out.json
```

**Parameters:**

`--input` (required)
- Path to input JSON file
- Must have a top-level array
- Example: `method_out.json`, `full_data_out.json`

`--output-dir` (optional)
- Output directory for generated files
- Default: same directory as input file
- Files are prefixed with `full_`, `mini_`, `preview_`

**Output Files:**

All three files use the same base name with different prefixes:
- `full_{basename}.json` - Complete dataset (identical to original)
- `mini_{basename}.json` - First 3 array items only
- `preview_{basename}.json` - First 3 items with strings truncated to 200 chars

**Tips:**
- Input JSON must have a top-level array structure
- String truncation is recursive (applies to nested objects and arrays)
- Use preview files for quick inspection without reading large datasets
- Use mini files for developing/testing code before running on full dataset

**If the script fails** with a connection error (ability server not running): create a local `.venv`, install server deps from `server_requirements.txt` into it, then import the `@aii_ability` function from the script and call it directly — bypassing the server:
```bash
uv venv .venv --python=3.12 && uv pip install --python=.venv/bin/python -r "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/server_requirements.txt"
```

CANDIDATE REPO SELECTION: build the repo candidate list by (a) pulling GitHub's own 'most starred' listings via API search (`/search/repositories?q=stars:>N&sort=stars`) stratified into >=3 star bands (e.g. 100-1000, 1000-10000, 10000+) and >=4 languages, deliberately including mid-popularity repos (not just top-500) since the hypothesis needs variance in size to avoid confounding; (b) for a first-pass filter, pull only repo metadata + contributor stats (cheap calls) for ~600-1000 candidates, compute first-year author-share to check for single-dominant-founder pattern and total history length (>=4-5 years), narrowing to the ~150-250 final candidates BEFORE pulling full per-commit history (expensive calls) — this two-pass approach avoids wasting the majority of the API/time budget on repos that get filtered out anyway.
  5. FULL COMMIT PULL: for the narrowed candidate list, pull full commit history with per-commit file-change stats, applying the 5,000-commit-per-repo cap and truncation flag described in the criteria; verify no repos triggered 'mining GitHub' artifacts (sudden history gaps, squash-merge patterns collapsing years into one commit date) by spot-checking commit-date distributions.
  6. VALIDATION: confirm final schema conforms to a per-repo JSON record with `repo_metadata` (stars, forks, language, license, created_at, contributor_count, readme_excerpt) and `commits` (list of {sha, author_email, author_login, date, files: [{path, insertions, deletions}]}) fields; run aii-json skill to validate against a defined JSON schema; check total output size against 300MB via aii-file-size-limit skill and produce full/mini/preview splits.
  7. FAILURE HANDLING: if GitHub API rate limits make 150-250 full-history pulls infeasible within the time budget even with a token (5,000 req/hour authenticated), reduce target repo count toward the lower end (150) and/or reduce per-repo commit cap, documenting the tradeoff in metadata rather than silently truncating; if GH Archive/BigQuery access is unavailable, rely solely on the GitHub REST API with aggressive caching and checkpointing (write partial results to disk incrementally so a rate-limit stall doesn't lose completed work) using the aii-long-running-tasks skill's gradual-scaling pattern — start with a small pilot batch (~20 repos) to validate the schema and pipeline end-to-end before scaling to the full target count.

<available_resources>
<software_constraints>
- Python only implementation
- Python standard library and all popular PyPI packages available (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, scipy, matplotlib, requests, etc.)
- Local parallelism encouraged: multiprocessing, asyncio, threading — see aii-parallel-computing skill
- LLM API calls must go through OpenRouter only (no direct OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- **SPEND BUDGET**: at most $10 USD of OpenRouter API calls for this artifact. Nothing outside your own code enforces this — the key you are given has no per-artifact cap — so it holds only if you track cumulative cost after every call and stop when you approach it. Budget the work up front: estimate the per-call cost and the number of calls BEFORE starting a sweep, not after it overruns. Exceeding it spends real money that the run cannot recover.

<available_data_sources>
Use the sources appropriate to your task. Read the relevant skill file BEFORE using each source.

- **HuggingFace Hub** (HF) — ML datasets (NLP, vision, tabular, benchmarks)
- **Our World in Data** (OWID) — Global statistics (energy, health, economics, environment, demographics)
- **Alternate methods** — Python/shell (sklearn.datasets, openml, direct URL, APIs, etc.)

If the plan specifies a source or one fits better, use it.
You may combine sources. Use web search (aii-web-tools skill) to research candidates (background, papers, provenance) — NOT to find/download datasets.
</available_data_sources>

<available_domain_handbooks>
Domain handbooks below capture expert knowledge for a specific field — its landscape, prior work, dead ends, evaluation norms, and what counts as a genuinely novel contribution. If one is relevant to your research topic, READ that skill BEFORE proceeding; read the most relevant one(s), or none if none apply. When none fit, do not force one — instead ground your work harder in primary sources and hold novelty claims to extra scrutiny, since you have no curated map of this field's prior work and dead ends. Use it for dataset selection, evaluation metrics, agent orchestration patterns.

<tool_use>
Maximize parallel tool calls. Parallelize independent operations, only sequentialize dependencies.
- Multiple searches/fetches on different topics → parallel in one turn
- Search then fetch results → sequential (need URLs first)
</tool_use>

<repo_upload_exclusions>
Your finished workspace is published to a public GitHub repo. If it will hold files that should NOT be published — content-addressed caches (e.g. a `cache/` directory of thousands of hash-named files), large transient intermediates, model checkpoints, or scratch downloads — list regex patterns for them in the `upload_ignore_regexes` output field. Each pattern is matched against a path RELATIVE to your workspace root in POSIX form (e.g. `(^|/)cache/`, `(^|/)checkpoints/`). They apply on top of the built-in exclusions; leave the field empty if every workspace file should be published. Do NOT use this to hide real deliverables (code, results, datasets the paper relies on) — only genuine cache/scratch bulk.

IMPORTANT: Your final response should be at most 300 characters long.

FIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list using your task/todo-tracking tool:

CRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES. These todos are intentionally detailed so that another LLM could read each one without any external context and understand exactly what it has to do.

<todos>
TODO 1. Update data.py to only include the chosen 1 dataset and generate full_data_out.json. Re-run to generate full_data_out.json. Validate output format with aii-json skill and fix any errors. Generate full, mini, and preview versions with aii-json skill's format script using `--input full_data_out.json` (creates full_full_data_out.json, mini_full_data_out.json, preview_full_data_out.json — rename to full_data_out.json, mini_data_out.json, preview_data_out.json).
TODO 2. Verify full_data_out.json, preview_data_out.json, and mini_data_out.json exist in your workspace (see <workspace>) and contain correct data.
TODO 3. Apply aii-file-size-limit skill's file size check procedure (100MB limit) to full_data_out.json.
TODO 4. Ensure a `pyproject.toml` exists in your workspace with ALL dependencies pinned to the exact versions installed in your .venv (run `.venv/bin/pip freeze` to get them). This is required for reproducibility. The [project] section must include name, version, requires-python, and a dependencies list with pinned versions (e.g. `numpy==2.0.2`, not `numpy>=2.0`).

name: aii-file-size-limit
description: File size check procedure for splitting oversized output files. Use after generating JSON output files to check and split files exceeding the provided size limit.
---

## File Size Check

After generating output files, run `ls -lh` to check sizes. If ANY file exceeds the provided file size limit:

1. Create directory with same base name (e.g., `data_out/` for `full_data_out.json`)
2. Split into parts under the limit named: `full_data_out_1.json`, `full_data_out_2.json`, etc.
3. Place parts in directory (e.g., `data_out/full_data_out_1.json`, `data_out/full_data_out_2.json`)
4. Delete the original oversized file
5. Update the script to read from split files: `for f in sorted(glob.glob('data_out/full_data_out_*.json')): data.extend(json.load(open(f)))`
6. For each split part, generate its own mini/preview versions with the json skill's format script
```
